Image: ShutterstockCreate an account to save your articles.Ethereum\u2019s Merge\u2014the blockchain\u2019s much-anticipated transition from its current proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithm\u2014will be one step closer today if the planned trial upgrade on the Ropsten public testnet goes as planned later today.\nFirst rolled out in 2016, Ropsten is Ethereum\u2019s oldest testnet that allows for blockchain development testing before deployment on the mainnet. Similar to other testnets, it is identical to the mainnet, with the key difference that no \u201creal\u201d funds are at risk if any technical issues occur.\nThe date for the upgrade was first announced on May 18 when Ethereum core developer Terence Tsao broke the news that configuration for Ropsten\u2019s Beacon Chain\u2014a PoS network that runs alongside Ethereum's mainnet\u2014had been merged and client releases should be expected soon.\n\nThings moved quickly after that, with another Ethereum developer, Tim Beiko, announcing the launch of a new beacon chain on May 30, and the Bellatrix upgrade\u2014one of the two required conditions for the Ropsten testnet Merge\u2014activated on June 2.\nThe developers also had to decide on the so-called \u201cTerminal Total Difficulty\u201d (TTD)\u2014a pre-decided difficulty value at which the Ropsten Merge occurs, something they did the following day setting the value at 50 quadrillion.\nAs explained by Beiko, such a high value was chosen \u201cbecause of the low PoW hash rate on testnets, and the risk of The Merge having happened before the network was ready with the Bellatrix update.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udce3 Ropsten Merge Update \ud83d\udce3\nAs mentioned in the Ropsten Merge Announcement, the terminal total difficulty (TTD) at which The Merge happens on Ropsten must be overridden by node operators & stakers. \nThe correct TTD value is 50000000000000000 \ud83d\udc40https://t.co/aPAWNJfDYh\n\u2014 Tim Beiko | timbeiko.eth \ud83d\udc3c (@TimBeiko) June 3, 2022\n\nPer the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s blog post, client software teams participating in the Ropsten Merge include Lighthouse, Lodestar, Prysm, Nimbus, Teku, Besu, Erigon, go-ethereum (geth) and Nethermind.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\nToday\u2019s Ropsten Merge is a crucial step before Ethereum\u2019s actual transition to the Consensus Layer (formerly known as ETH 2.0) slated for August this year.\nIn essence, it gives developers the first taste of what things will look like in the future when Ethereum finally makes the move to a less energy-intensive PoS algorithm mechanism. And it\u2019s quite clear that a successful Merge on the testnet would bode well for the Ethereum\u2019s mainnet\u2019s own transition.\n\n\u201cMerging Ropsten is a huge testing milestone towards Ethereum's mainnet Merge later this year,\u201d Ethereum Core developer Preston van Loon wrote last month.\nThis process has been in the works for some years though, with multiple delays sending waves of frustration among the community and investors.\nThe new PoS model is supposed to solve some of Ethereum\u2019s biggest issues, such as high transaction costs and the network\u2019s ability to scale, so the stakes are indeed high, with the biggest upgrade in Ethereum\u2019s history\u2014if successful\u2014 having a good chance to become the crypto industry\u2019s event of the year.\nCopy linkWant to be a crypto expert?

Image: ShutterstockCreate an account to save your articles.Following Terra\u2019s $40 billion implosion last month, the Cosmos ecosystem is on the hunt for a new decentralized stablecoin.\u00a0\nToday, the team at cross-chain protocol Umee announced DAI will be filling that gap.\u00a0\n\u201cThe UST collapse made it absolutely clear that the Cosmos ecosystem needs a robust, safe stablecoin,\u201d Umee\u2019s CEO Brent Xu told Decrypt. \u201cLooking ahead, Umee\u2019s broader mission includes creating cross-chain stablecoins and adding Cosmos assets to MakerDAO.\u201d\u00a0\nUnlike Terra\u2019s UST, DAI is an overcollateralized stablecoin with a market capitalization of $6.9 billion. It\u2019s still magnitudes smaller than market leader Tether (USDT), but it\u2019s also built a whole lot differently.\u00a0\nIn order to mint, for example, $1 of DAI, you need to deposit up to $1.75 in Ethereum. A host of other cryptocurrencies are also eligible to be used as collateral, including Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), Uniswap (UNI), Polygon (MATIC), and others.\u00a0\nEach collateral asset carries its own \u201cminimum collateral ratio,\u201d too, which dictates how much of said asset you need to put up to mint DAI.\u00a0\nData dashboard DAI Stats indicates that the most popular collateral for minting Maker\u2019s stablecoin is Circle\u2019s USDC. This dominance has also drawn criticism to DAI\u2019s claim of being a \u201cdecentralized\u201d stablecoin, given how centralized USDC is.\nSource: DAI Stats.\nDAI is already integrated with over 20 different crypto networks, including Solana, Fantom, and Polygon, according to DeFi Llama.\u00a0\nWhat is Umee?\nThough users will technically be leveraging Gravity Bridge, a connector between Cosmos and EVM-compatible blockchains, for their DAI transfers, Xu claims Umee is much more than just a bridge protocol.\n\"Other protocols use bridges to create wrapped assets\u2014essentially a quantity of a blockchain\u2019s native currency equivalent to the non-native asset. Umee is unlike these protocols,\" he told Decrypt. \u201cInstead of building a bridge, we allow users to lend and collateralize, without creating any additional wrapped assets, to get exposure and participate in another ecosystem.\".\n\nIn plain terms, this means Umee is building out a tool that would let users lend and borrow typically non-compatible cryptocurrencies. \nThe idea has earned the attention of several notable investment groups too.\u00a0\nLast June, Umee landed $6.3 million in backing from Coinbase Ventures, Polychain, and others. \nCopy linkWant to be a crypto expert?

You can create a virtual card in around 15 seconds inside of Edge.\"\nWhile privacy is key, Puey says economic empowerment is the defining principle behind the Edge Mastercard.\n\"I've known a handful of people that are unbanked; they simply cannot get a bank account for whatever reason,\" Puey says.\nThe new card is not only for Bitcoin. Puey tells Decrypt that users can sell Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Dash to fund their Edge Mastercard to shop at eligible merchants in the United States.\n\nAt launch, the Edge Mastercard will have a daily spend limit of $1,000 and can be used with Apple Pay with Samsung and Google Pay coming later. The option to order a physical card for $20 is coming later this month.\nTo fund their account, Edge customers sell their Bitcoin inside their wallet and send the USD to their Edge Mastercard to make purchases instead of sending the funds to a bank account.\nThere are no fees to add funds to a card, Puey adds, explaining that those who wish to shop at an online store can copy and paste their card's information and add a shipping/billing address to the order.\n\nEdge is the latest among Web3 companies making its way into the Bitcoin payments space for making everyday purchases. In April, Digital asset manager Nexo partnered with Mastercard to launch a Mastercard-backed crypto card in selected European markets. In December, Ledger announced the launch of a debit card that will let users spend their crypto directly or as collateral for cash purchases using the Ledger Live platform.\nCopy linkWant to be a crypto expert?

That's the lowest that figure has been this year, but still 32% higher than it was in May 2021, according to the report.\nBad-but-better-than-last-year seemed to be a theme across dApp categories, with NFTs and gaming having fared the best.\n\nOverall NFT market volume fell 45% to $10 billion, down from $18 billion in April. That was primarily due to the fact that blue-chip collections had a rough month.\nFor example, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) saw its floor price slide 38% during May, from 150 Ethereum to 93. But the loss has been a boon for newer collections like Otherdeeds, land parcels for the BAYC metaverse game, and Goblintown, which has done $31 million in trading volume since its launch.\n\"What we\u2019re seeing right now is part of the evolution of the NFT market where new collections with intriguing factors are getting a lot of attention, draining liquidity from other projects and appraising themselves,\" senior blockchain analyst at Dapp Radar Pedro Herrara told Decrypt. \"This is the case of Goblintown, Otherside and recently launched We are all going to die.\"\n\n\"It feels like NFTs are becoming assets that could decouple from financial markets at some point,\" DappRadar wrote, drawing a comparison to the fact that the Artprice100 index dipped only 26% during the Great Recession of 2008 while the S&P 500 lost 56% of its value.\nCrypto gaming offers green shoots\nMeanwhile, the bright spot in gaming has been the flow of venture capital into the category.\nDapper Labs launched a $725 million fund to spur growth on its Flow ecosystem and Andreessen Horowitz's a16z launched its GAMES FUND ONE, which will invest $600 million in the metaverse gaming industry.\nAll the market turbulence meant that DeFi was the hardest hit dApp category, according to DappRadar. The total value locked (TVL) across DeFi apps dropped by 45% but was still up 11% compared to a year ago.\n\nThe report notes that Polygon, Near, Optimism, and Arbitrum appear poised to pick up market share as apps leaving the Terra ecosystem.\nMeanwhile, Justin Sun's Tron (TRX) was the only blockchain DappRadar tracks to experience growth in May, having increased its TVL by 47%.\nBy the end of May, Tron's Terra-like USDD algorithmic stablecoin had reached a market cap of $603 million. Already in the first week of June, it's added another $100 million for a total market cap of $703 million, according to CoinMarketCap.\nCopy linkWant to be a crypto expert?

Lamis co-founded UnicornDAO with Pussy Riot's Nadya Tolokonnikova to support marginalized and underrepresented groups in Web3.\n\nUnpacking NFTs' PR problem\nNFTs are blockchain-based tokens that show ownership over digital or physical assets.\nAs the NFT market has risen, fallen, and risen again\u2014and has often been represented by million-dollar monkey JPEGs\u2014critics have dismissed them as stupid, a money grab, a scam, or an environmental scourge due to how much energy is used to maintain the Ethereum blockchain, on which most NFTs are minted.\nPoliticians have also lumped in NFTs with their concerns about crypto mining.\n\nNFTs have faced significant pushback in particular from the gaming community. In November, chat app Discord, which built its user base from gamers and is now also popular with crypto groups, halted plans to integrate crypto wallets following overwhelming outcry from users.\nIn December, game studio GSC Game World canceled plans to add NFTs to its \"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2\" title, and in February game developer Team17 canceled entirely its planned NFT game \"MetaWorms\" after gamers rejected the concept.\nLamis believes that despite the debate over NFTs, the conversation has allowed the space to grow further, as the general public is becoming curious and wants to learn more about NFTs and Web3.\nShe says that most of the people in Web3 she has worked with became active only in the last year, a sign the market is still in its very early innings.\n\n\"A lot of them are some of the most well-established artists globally, but they are making and generating more money from their art in one single [NFT] drop than they would traditionally do in a year,\" she said. \"And that's so powerful.\" She and Aversano hope to use Quantum as a space for in-person connection and also education; Lamis hopes to open more locations across the country.\n\"I'm thrilled and really interested to see how it plays out, and how we could potentially change the narrative of 'NFTs are bad' and 'NFTs are not eco-friendly,'\" Lamis says. \"I think there's a lot of impact we can do in that capacity.\"\nCopy linkWant to be a crypto expert?

Image: ShutterstockCreate an account to save your articles.The price of LINK, the token underpinning the decentralized oracle network Chainlink, has soared to a daily high of $8.86 on Wednesday, a level last seen on May 10.\nThough a minor correction has brought LINK to $8.41 by press time, it still represents a solid increase of 10.42% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.\nThis also makes Chainlink's token one of the best-performing assets in the last day as the broader crypto market continues to experience bouts of volatility.\nWith a market capitalization of over $3.9 billion, Chainlink is currently the industry's 21st-largest digital currency.\n\nChainlink Economics 2.0\nLINK's latest price action follows the publication of its updated roadmap for the implementation of staking\u2014a feature that would enable a system of rewards and penalties designed to incentivize the network's proper operation.\nFirst outlined in an April 2021 white paper and followed by a January 2022 teaser, the idea of earning passive income through staking on Chainlink revolves around giving the ecosystem participants, such as node operators and community members, the ability to increase the security guarantees of oracle services by backing them with staked LINK tokens.\nThe initial implementation of Chainlink, called v0.1, is projected for the second half of 2022 and will mark the beginning of Chainlink Economics 2.0, the project's \"new era of sustainable growth and security.\"\n\nStaking marks the start of #Chainlink Economics 2.0, a new era for the long-term security and sustainability of oracle networks.\nIn this update, we define the long-term goals, roadmap, and initial implementation of staking in the Chainlink Network.https://t.co/WJkoUzPA0i\n\u2014 Chainlink (@chainlink) June 7, 2022\n\nPointing to the deep integration of Chainlink's oracles with leading crypto applications, the company said that \"the increase in oracle security and user assurances brought about by staking will be key in helping the multi-chain smart contract economy scale to eventually secure multi-trillion-dollar markets across major global industries.\"\nAccording to Chainlink, the rollout of the staking mechanism will be similar to the deployment of Chainlink Price Feeds\u2014the company's popular price oracle network for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\nThe latter started with a single price feed for ETH/USD operated by three oracle nodes and grew to support almost a thousand price feeds powered by more than 50 node operators across twelve blockchains and layer-2 solutions.\nCurrently, Chainlink is trusted by some of the most valuable DeFi apps, including Aave, Compound, dYdX, Synthetix, Nexus Mutual, and more.\nThe most recent integration happened last week, with Solana adding support for Chainlink Price Feeds.\n\nChainlink staking rewards\nAccording to Chainlink, the initial staking pool will start with an aggregate size of 25 million LINK tokens, with the goal of expanding to 75 million tokens\u2014based on demand\u2014in the following months after the launch.\nThe v0.1 staking pool will also be capped in size, offering \"a fair entry mechanism [\u2026] to help ensure participation from a wide range of community members.\"\n\"This entry mechanism will aim to prioritize long-term token holders, who are most likely to actively participate in the alerting mechanism,\" said Chainlink.\n\nThe company added that \"stakers participating in the v0.1 release will have their staked LINK locked until at least the release of v1, where they will then be able to choose commitment periods of varying lengths.\"\nAside from that, separate allotments will be offered to node operators that actively service Chainlink Data Feeds.\nDisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.\nCopy linkWant to be a crypto expert?

(Photograph: Chie Endo)Create an account to save your articles.Custodia, the crypto bank founded by former Morgan Stanley managing director Caitlin Long, today sued the Federal Reserve for what it claims has been a \"patently unlawful delay\" in reviewing the bank\u2019s application for a master account.\u00a0\nCustodia, formerly known as Avanti, is one of a select number of businesses permitted under a Wyoming law to become Special Purpose Depository Institutions (SPDI), capable of conducting both crypto transactions and traditional banking services. \nHowever, crypto-friendly Wyoming\u2019s authority only reaches so far: for a bank to wield such power, it needs a \"master account\" at the Federal Reserve.\nAll federally-chartered banks possess a master account, which allows for direct payments with and access to the Fed. Custodia applied to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for a master account 19 months ago. \nAccording to the lawsuit, they still haven\u2019t heard back.\u00a0\n\nThe lawsuit, filed against the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, claims that this delay has violated a one-year statutory deadline for approving such applications. In fact, the Fed\u2019s application paperwork for a master account cites a typical turnaround time of five to seven business days.\nCustodia applied for their master account just after receiving their Wyoming bank charter in October 2020. Per the lawsuit, a representative of the Kansas City Fed then informed Custodia in early 2021 that the application was complete and featured \"no showstoppers.\"\nAnd yet, for Custodia, no decision came for all of 2021.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified during a Senate hearing in January that the abnormal delay in processing Custodia\u2019s master account application \u2014 as well as that of Kraken, the San Francisco-based crypto exchange \u2014 was due to the \"hugely precedential\" nature of granting crypto companies traditional banking powers.\u00a0\n\nAt that same hearing, Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) argued such a tactic amounted to \"deny by delay\" and aimed to \"starv[e] the applicants until they die.\"\nNotably, Custodia\u2019s application has also not been denied. Powell testified in January that there were \"good arguments\" for granting Custodia or Kraken a master account. And as recently as March 22, according to the lawsuit, a representative of the Kansas City Fed re-confirmed to Custodia that the company was \u201clegally eligible for a master account.\u201d\n\nCustodia charges fed with delays\nCustodia\u2019s lawsuit today alleges that the Fed\u2019s failure to act has cost the company greatly, requiring it to launch with a correspondent bank that possesses its own master account. Such an arrangement, according to Custodia\u2019s attorneys, \u201celiminates much of the competitive benefit that Custodia would enjoy from using the charter that Wyoming granted it.\u201d\nThe Kansas City Fed did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story.\nIf Custodia\u2019s application for a master account were to be approved, it would mark a major milestone in the integration of crypto into the American economy. \nCrypto businesses would be able to provide a suite of services offered by traditional banks to traditional businesses. The bank would also be able to provide simultaneous settlement of trades between digital assets and the dollar.\u00a0\nToday\u2019s suit requests the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming to intervene and compel the Fed to make a decision on Custodia\u2019s application in the next thirty days.\nThe implications of the suit, and of the Fed\u2019s impending decision, were not lost on the broader crypto community.

Image: AdimCreate an account to save your articles.In brief\nAdim is a new Web3 entertainment company from actor and creator Rob McElhenney.\nThe startup will use decentralized writers\u2019 rooms to develop IP and then share in future royalties or revenue with NFT-holding co-creators.\nThe Web3 world is built on a decentralized, collaborative ethos\u2014and it\u2019s pulling in creators from traditional media industries who want to try something new. Now, actor and filmmaker Rob McElhenney from hit TV series \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u201d aims to use the tech to co-create content and share in the potential royalties ahead.\nAdim is McElhenney\u2019s new \u201centertainment-tech\u201d company, which will see the \u201cAlways Sunny\u201d and \u201cMythic Quest\u201d co-creator and star work alongside emerging creators to develop new characters and story ideas. The \u201cAdimverse\u201d will span original IP created by the participants, and those co-creators will benefit from future entertainment projects that tap into that IP.\n\u201cEvery beloved character throughout TV, movie, and gaming history has been imagined and brought to life through collaboration,\u201d said McElhenney, in a release. \u201cAdim is building for the next evolution of these groups\u2014communities of creators, writers, artists, designers, developers, fans, and friends working together to create and own a new generation of content.\u201d\nIn the initial format, 100 creators will be chosen from all applicants to join a virtual writer\u2019s room with Adim co-founder and Co-Chairman McElhenney plus TV writer Keyonna Taylor. At the end of each session, all participants will receive a \u201cCore Character\u201d NFT that conveys a share of ownership over the IP that was developed in that cohort.\n\nCome do something weird with us at \u2066https://t.co/MRdpnHxudU @Adimverse\u2069 pic.twitter.com/etfMoRuzrl\n\u2014 Rob McElhenney (@RMcElhenney) June 7, 2022\n\nUltimately, owners of those non-transferrable NFTs will be eligible to receive royalties or revenue share from any projects that use their co-created IP. While the Adimverse website doesn\u2019t specifically note which blockchain network will be used for the NFTs, it mentions Ethereum gas fees (the costs associated with transacting on the Ethereum network) and cites Ethereum wallets like MetaMask and Rainbow.\nAn NFT is a blockchain token that serves as a proof of ownership to an item, and often represents digital goods like profile pictures, artwork, collectibles, and video game items. They can also work like ownership shares, as in this example and others\u2014such as rapper Ice Cube\u2019s BIG3 basketball league selling team ownership shares via NFTs.\n\nAdim has raised $5 million in seed funding in a round led by VC firm Andreessen Horowitz. General Partner Chris Dixon tweeted about the funding today.\n\u201cBlockchains are social mediums. Composability gives artists the power to take assets & information generated by NFTs or protocols and use them anywhere on-chain,\u201d Dixon wrote, in part. \u201cAdimverse community members could fork characters created by users and build outward from the original Adim universe.\u201d\n\nAlongside McElhenney, Adim was co-founded by serial entrepreneur Richard Rosenblatt alongside Chase Rosenblatt, Melissa Kaspers, and Spencer Marell. Richard Rosenblatt is also co-founder of Autograph, a sports and entertainment NFT company that includes NFL quarterback Tom Brady as a fellow co-founder.\nAdim\u2019s board of advisors includes McElhenney\u2019s wife and \u201cAlways Sunny\u201d co-star Kaitlin Olson, as well as actor Ryan Reynolds, who co-owns Welsh soccer team Wrexham A.F.C. with McElhenney.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first Web3 project to take a stab at collaborative creation with an NFT component. Archie Comics, for example, recently revealed an Archieverse project that lets NFT owners take part in a large-scale writer\u2019s room to develop comic book stories.\nLost Children of Andromeda, meanwhile, lets NFT collectors develop characters that may be used in author Jason Michael Primrose\u2019s future sci-fi novels. Likewise, The Gimmicks\u2014a project co-created by the studio of actress Mila Kunis\u2014is a wrestling-themed animated series that lets NFT owners develop character and story details for the show.\nCopy linkWant to be a crypto expert?

Image: ShutterstockCreate an account to save your articles.Binance US, the American affiliate of the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, is now offering cryptocurrency staking services to its clients\u2014a move that the company expects will make it more competitive against other U.S.-based rivals, such as Coinbase.\nStaking services are now available to Binance US customers holding any of seven select proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies: Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cosmos (ATOM), The Graph (GRT), Livepeer (LPT), and Audius (AUDIO). According to the company\u2019s Twitter account, more options will be made available in the future.\nProof of stake is a consensus mechanism used by many blockchain networks that require users to lock up their coins for permission to validate the next block. When validating, these users typically earn a reward that is tied to the transaction fees collected from that block.\n\nThe more coins that users lock up, the better their chances are of validating a block and thus generating more rewards. However, many blockchains have minimum funding requirements, which means smaller holders need to pool their funds together if they want to earn rewards. Ethereum 2.0, for example, requires a minimum of 32 ETH (worth roughly $57,000 at the moment) to participate in staking.\nCryptocurrency exchanges have since emerged as one of the primary vehicles for users with less than the required minimum to participate in staking and earn rewards by joining a pool.\nBinance US\u2019s service, much like that of its competitors Coinbase and Gemini, allows anyone to stake, with varying rates depending on the cryptocurrency chosen. While the company promises 6.4% annualized returns on its native BNB token, for example, it offers 18% APY for staking for Livepeer\u2014a decentralized live video streaming network.\n\nThese rates, however, are subject to change, according to \u201cestimates that are calculated based on the average staking rewards accrued over the past 90 days,\u201d the company said.\nStaking on Binance US appears to lack a lock-up period, meaning stakers can unstake their coins at any time. It does, however, charge some commission for \u201cfacilitating all technical staking requirements.\u201d\nCopy linkWant to be a crypto expert?

Meanwhile, exclusive merchandise will be released for NFT holders in November.\nOnce the campaign is done in early 2023 and all promised utility fulfilled, Budweiser and Zed Run will offer a \u201cburn-to-earn\u201d incentive\u2014a choice of as-yet-unrevealed rewards for \u201cburning\u201d or permanently destroying the Budweiser Pass NFT.\n\nBudweiser has made a number of moves in the NFT space since last fall, beginning with buying the beer.eth Ethereum Name Service name, which is akin to a web domain name that can be assigned to a crypto wallet.\nThe brand also used an NFT from the Tom Sachs: Rocket Factory project as its Twitter profile picture at the time. Soon thereafter, Budweiser released its own Heritage Can NFTs, which were billed as a \u201ckey to the Budverse\u201d with various incentives and perks.\n\nBud Light followed suit with its own NFT passes, and then partnered with Ethereum NFT project Nouns to join its decentralized collective.
