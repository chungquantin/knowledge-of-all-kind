                "Crypto conferences used to be quite the scene in Shanghai: fancy venues in five-star hotels, rooftop bars overlooking Huangpu River at The Bund, where chandeliers sparkled above well-dressed, champagne-sipping attendees, chatting the night away before heading out to clubs where more champagne gets poured.",
                "That scene is no more, now that China\u2019s \u201czero Covid\u201d policy has turned the buzzing city into a ghost town. Some residents have reported being cooped up in their homes for three months, not once stepping outside.",
                "But the lockdown did not stop ETH Shanghai from happening\u2014this year, a virtual-only event.",
                "ETH Shanghai went live May 20 with an unusual list of speakers: a combination of high-flying Chinese and U.S. government officials, and O.G. Ethereum founders.",
                "The two groups couldn\u2019t have been in greater contrast, and the dichotomy reflects how the crypto community is trying to survive in China: striking a balance between being politically correct (at least in public) but still true to crypto\u2019s grassroots spirits.",
                "What\u2019s really going on in the Chinese community these days?",
                "I just got a phone call from a business school friend. He had started an Invisalign-esque direct-to-consumer company in Shanghai in 2019. The team raised a bunch of VC money, but couldn\u2019t gain adoption. As a result, he pivoted from oral health\u2014a rather hot industry back in the day\u2014to crypto.\u00a0",
                "My friend is far from alone. Web2 talent has been severely crippled by the Chinese government\u2019s \u201czero COVID\u201d policy and tech crackdown. Major tech giants\u2019 stocks have halved, if not worse. Many brilliant engineers have seen no salary increases, nor equity bumps. What\u2019s worse, many companies have started to lay off engineers in anticipation of a global economic slowdown.",
                "Tech giants have become tech dwarves.",
                "In the meantime, these brilliant engineers are seeing their not-so-talented friends getting rich by buying profile pictures, participating in algo-stable Ponzi schemes, or even walking on StepN.",
                "Many of them said they feel bitter, yet still want to join the Web3 Ponzi revolution.",
                "Now comes the tricky part. To join the revolution, these engineers must always account for regulation, because the Chinese government is not expected to revert its crypto ban any time soon.",
                "Three creative strategies have emerged as Chinese founders navigate the space:\u00a0",
                "Anonymity",
                "Most projects choose the anonymous route because it\u2019s safer to stay under the radar. The issue, however, is the type of projects that Chinese founders tend to start. During DeFi summers, many simply forked existing western projects and launched yield farms. During NFT summers, many simply contracted a Fiverr designer and launched 10,000 monkey PFP projects with a fake roadmap.",
                "Not all Chinese projects are rugpulls, of course. But anyone who wants to build a serious business has to stay low key, which means they have to refrain from public marketing, shilling, or narrative building. Without marketing, projects struggle to take off.\u00a0",
                "Academia",
                "The second route allows you to be public about being a blockchain startup by waving the academic flag. Many of China\u2019s layer-1 protocols like Conflux used this tactic. They openly collaborate with university professors, research labs, and innovation centers. Many also have an active student community that helps organize meetups, hackathons, even mini-conferences.",
                "Western Web2 companies want to collaborate with these \u201cdeep tech\u201d companies as well, to keep up with the innovation curve.\u00a0",
                "These projects are in the safe zone, at least temporarily, because China wants to develop capability in the areas of distributed systems, cryptography, privacy, and blockchain.",
                "The main challenge these projects might face is if they ultimately launch a token, and that token becomes volatile. The Chinese government does not like volatility, and it might extend the ban to block these projects.",
                "Apart",
                "The last option, and an increasingly popular one, is a combination of having founders and marketers living abroad, while the tech and delivery team live quietly in China. This model allows teams to raise VC money from international funds, run campaigns that target global audiences, and build robust communities, enjoying China\u2019s low-cost tech labor without the worry of being censored by the Chinese government.",
                "Amusingly, most projects that follow this model tend to claim that \u201cwe are not a China project,\u201d as if being associated with China is bad.",
                " This brings to my next observation: China is not a place, it\u2019s its people.",
                "As Chinese projects expand abroad in a time of increasing decentralization, China has become less a place and more about its people. The people can live in Singapore, Australia, America, or Europe. Location doesn\u2019t stop them from organizing, supporting, and participating in ETH Shanghai.",
                "We\u2019re already seeing Chinese diasporas making a mark in the crypto space. Remember earlier in the year when I predicted that China would produce a hit crypto game? Well, that\u2019s already happened with the rise of StepN, a move-to-earn game that ignited an Axie Infinity-like frenzy.",
                "The project, standing\u00a0at a market cap of $680M, is founded by Chinese diasporas in Australia, supported by VCs in India, China, America, and practically everywhere else.\u00a0",
                "Even as the world became increasingly segregated in the time of COVID, the boundaries around what it means to be Chinese are truly blurred. What unites us all isn\u2019t so much nationality, but the spirit of crypto.",
                "Granted, that spirit is affected by a wider array of factors, judging from how many of my friends escaped China in recent months to start a nomadic, crypto-focused life.",
                "Still, I\u2019m optimistic.",

                "The news is bad. And if you're an engineer who got a letter from Coinbase canceling a job offer you already accepted, there's no silver lining here. It's enough to make someone sour on working in the crypto industry at all.",
                "But if you zoom out, there's reason not to panic.",
                "Those calling this period the end of crypto (and there are so many saying it) clearly weren't in this industry in 2018. During that time, in which Bitcoin tanked 70% after peaking at $20,000, I kept hearing the same refrain from crypto execs and entrepreneurs I'd welcome on Yahoo Finance live shows: \"We're putting our heads down and building now.\" It was difficult not to scoff at that talking point back then, because what else could they say? But many of the tools and platforms built during that time became the key success stories of the pandemic-prompted crypto boom in 2020 and 2021. They really did build things.",
                "This is why it's reasonable for Dan Held, a Bitcoin O.G. who sold his price app ZeroBlock to Blockchain.com in 2013 long before he was a Twitter influencer with 600,000 followers, to declare that this Crypto Winter will be milder than past winters.",
                "Held joined me for a chat at CoinMarketCap's virtual conference last week and said people are now going back \"from HODL to BUIDL... The original Bitcoin ethos was all about building. Back in the early era, everyone had their own side project because they needed to go build something to make the ecosystem better. ... Now we've got A-players across all of tech wanting to come build things in the crypto ecosystem, we've got VC funds raising tens of billions of dollars in aggregate to go deploy into this ecosystem, so I don't think this winter is going to be as harsh as the other ones.\"",
                "Another crucial point about this Crypto Winter is that non-crypto tech stocks aren't faring any better right now. Pandemic darlings Peloton (PTON) and Zoom (ZM) are down 60% and 40% this year, respectively. How about those once-hallowed FAANG names? Facebook (changing its stock ticker to META next week) is down 45% this year, Amazon (AMZN) is down 28%, Apple is down 20%, Netflix (NFLX) is down 68% (goodness gracious), and Alphabet (GOOG) is down 22%.",
                "No matter what, rescinding job offers is a terrible look, and Coinbase's reputation will now take yet another P.R. hit. But companies often have to cut head count during downturns\u2014it's what they do to survive. When other large companies make job cuts (like in March 2020) the media reaction is not to declare their industry dead. But crypto, in the big scheme of things, is still so new (even after 13 years for Bitcoin) that skeptics still insist the entire thing could collapse.",
