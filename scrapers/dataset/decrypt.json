Chan is bullish on Pintu and Indonesia\u2019s crypto economy despite the global market downturn in part because of what he calls a \u201cvery, very long-term view.\u201d\n\nChan said he is a firm believer in Pintu founder and CEO Jeth Soetoyo, as well as Pintu\u2019s user-friendly interfaces as well as its educational focus, saying the app could become \u201cthe Coinbase of Southeast Asia.\u201d\nHe\u2019s also bullish on crypto adoption in Indonesia specifically, and said that Indonesia\u2019s fiat currency inflation, young demographics, rising middle class, growing population, and a national interest in cryptocurrency are why he\u2019s optimistic on the future of crypto as a whole in the country.\n\nSoetoyo has a similar view.\n\u201cIndonesia\u2019s crypto market has demonstrated remarkable growth over the past year, fueled by regulatory encouragement and increased grassroots awareness,\u201d Soetoyo said in a statement. \u201cCrypto adoption in Indonesia is only in its beginning stages, and educating users on the fundamentals is critical to ensuring this growth continues in a healthy way.\u201d\nInterest in crypto has certainly increased in the country, with the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency reporting that the number of Indonesians trading crypto has doubled to more than 12 million traders in the past year. \nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

They also include the use of Premier League trademarks in \u201cvirtual, augmented, and mixed reality software.\u201d\n\nAn NFT is a digital asset that represents the ownership of media, often digital illustrations, profile pictures, or music. They\u00a0are\u00a0minted\u00a0on\u00a0public blockchains\u00a0like\u00a0Ethereum\u00a0or\u00a0Solana,\u00a0and\u00a0each\u00a0token\u00a0is\u00a0unique.\nThe market for NFTs has grown in recent years as more companies cast their hats into the ring. One of the most notable NFT projects in the sports world is NBA Top Shot, launched in 2020. The collection recently surpassed over $1 billion in sales, according to CryptoSlam.\u00a0\n\nWhile demand for cryptocurrencies and NFTs has cooled in light of a recent decline in the overall crypto market, NFT sales are still on pace to exceed the $20 billion in volume recorded last year. The space has been a growing area for celebrities, artists and cultural icons to connect with their fans and cultivate a sense of community online.\nThe application of digital currencies is becoming increasingly common throughout the sports world, especially among football clubs. Last month, Arsenal announced a partnership with Unagi as part of their free to play game where player cards could be purchased as NFTs.\n\nThe game allows its users to keep player cards as collectables, sell them on an open market for in-game currency or trade the cards with other players. For fans of football, it could be a sign of what\u2019s to come in the future for the Premier League.\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

First released in 2017, it now has more than 350 million registered users worldwide.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a Fortnite cryptocurrency,\u201d Sweeney wrote. \u201cThe Twitter accounts promoting such a thing are a scam. Epic\u2019s lawyers are on it. Also, shame on the cryptocurrency marketplaces that enable this kind of thing.\u201d\n\nThere isn't a Fortnite cryptocurrency. The Twitter accounts promoting such a thing are a scam. Epic's lawyers are on it. Also, shame on the cryptocurrency marketplaces that enable this kind of thing.\n\u2014 Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) June 6, 2022\n\nSpecifically, Sweeney is referring to the \u201cFortnite Token\u201d (FNT), which is reportedly trading on decentralized exchanges SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, and CronaSwap.\nA quick search for the alleged scam token on those exchanges does not currently return any results, though these decentralized exchanges enable their users to trade virtually any token so long as those users manually input the token\u2019s contract address.\n\u201cThis account is operating a scam,\u201d Sweeney wrote, referring to the Twitter account @fortnite_token. \u201cAnybody involved in this is being scammed,\u201d he added in another response.\n\nThe Twitter account behind the unauthorized Fortnite token tried to argue that it wasn\u2019t a scam despite the \u201cCEO of Fortnite\u201d stating numerous times it was one.\n\u201cThis is a fair-launch, community-driven, Fortnite game fans-created cryptocurrency project with no specified owner or company structure behind it or a CEO deciding on its future,\u201d the token\u2019s account responded.\nSweeney was not amused.\n\u201cYou can't use the Fortnite name and images without permission to market an unrelated product,\u201d he replied.\nSweeney made at least 10 tweets in response to the \"Fortnite token\" he calls a \"scam.\" Image: Twitter.\nThe alleged scammers are also encouraging Fortnite fans to mint NFTs with their tokens, which Sweeney called\u2014unsurprisingly\u2014a \u201cscam.\u201d\nAccording to Nomics data, it appears that few are trading the FNT token. Since January, FNT is down 96% from its all-time high and is worth nearly zero at $0.0000007673. In the past 24 hours, the token has only seen about $250 in total volume traded.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time malicious actors have reportedly used Fortnite\u2019s branding without Epic\u2019s consent. Back in October, reports surfaced that scammers were promising gamers that they could exchange their V-Bucks, Fortnite\u2019s non-crypto, digital currency, for dollars using an unauthorized \u201cFortnite Coin.\u201d\n\nWhile Epic Games doesn\u2019t have any Fortnite-related cryptocurrency, the company is leaning into Web3. Gala Games\u2019 upcoming release GRIT\u2014which features NFTs\u2014will be the first blockchain game to be released on the Epic Games store. NFTs are unique tokens that are used to demonstrate ownership over digital assets, such as in-game items.\nSweeney previously shared back in September, however, that Epic Games isn\u2019t \u201ctouching NFTs as the whole field is currently tangled up with an intractable mix of scams.\u201d\nToday, he clarified his position.\n\u201cWhen new technology emerges, some put it to good use, and others put it to bad use. It would be terribly shortsighted to ban an entire field of technology for such a reason.\u201d\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

Today, it's getting a fresh look from U.S. regulators, according to Bloomberg.\nBy Ryan OzawaJun 6, 2022Jun 6, 20223 min readCreate an account to save your articles.The initial coin offering that served as the cornerstone of the launch of the Binance cryptocurrency exchange in 2017 is getting a fresh look from federal regulators.\nAccording to anonymous sources cited in\u00a0a Bloomberg report today by Tom Schoenberg and colleagues, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is revisiting the origins of the exchange's Binance Coin (BNB) for potential violations of securities regulations. Since its launch in 2017, Binance has become far and away the largest cryptocurrency exchange on the market by trading volume.\nNews of the federal regulatory probe comes just as Reuters released the results of an unrelated investigation in which the news service claims that at least $2.35 billion in illicit funds have been laundered through Binance between 2017 and 2021.\n\nIt is unclear what prompted this latest look back by the SEC, but BNB is currently the fifth-largest cryptocurrency, according to CoinMarketCap, logging a total market cap of $48 billion and 24-hour trading volume of $1.4 billion as of this writing.\n\nAt the heart of the case is the SEC's regulatory authority over investment contracts, and whether digital currencies qualify as such\u2014particularly if they are sold to investors as a way to fund a company with the promise of profiting from the company\u2019s efforts.\nBNB was created in July 2017 as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain before shifting to a separate Binance Chain. The initial coin offering of 100 million tokens at 15 cents per token raised $15 million. Now the native currency on the Binance crypto exchange, BNB can be traded directly, used to make purchases and payments, and pay a discounted rate on Binance transaction fees.\n\nBloomberg asserts that Binance \"faces multiple investigations in Washington,\" which in turn are part of dozens of enforcement actions over ICOs.\nIn a statement to the financial news outlet, Binance said, \u201cIt would not be appropriate for us to comment on our ongoing conversations with regulators, which include education, assistance, and voluntary responses to information requests,\u201d adding, \u201cWe will continue to meet all requirements set by regulators.\u201d\n\nThose regulators may also be looking at Binance US, an affiliate company founded in 2019, and whether it's sufficiently separated from its global parent.\nBloomberg quoted company officials in clarifying that \u201cBinance.US is a separate US-focused trading platform that services US users by offering products and services that are compliant with US federal and state regulations,\" and a separate statement from Binance US affirming its commitment to compliance.\n\nIn March, Binance was hit with a\u00a0$5 million class-action lawsuit\u00a0in which users claimed the exchange sold them 79 different crypto assets (including Dogecoin, Solana, and Cardano) that should have been handled as licensed securities.\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

(BLOCK), Coinbase (COIN), and Marathon Digital (MARA). Its metaverse fund holds shares of companies like the recently rebranded Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) and Adobe (ADBE).\nMany crypto companies have implemented hiring freezes, layoffs or rescinded job offers in an attempt to brace for Crypto Winter. Despite that, and the funds receiving criticism from Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tina Smith of Minnesota, Fidelity now manages a combined $22 million over two crypto funds.\n\nThe Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF added $2.4 million, and the Fidelity Metaverse ETF added $1.1 million. Each of the funds has a total of $11 million in assets under management, according to Coinshares.\nThe biggest outflow last week came from the Invesco Coinshares Global Blockchain UCITS ETF, which saw investors pull $21.6 million\u201482% of the $26.3 million net outflow that Monday\u2019s report noted for blockchain equity funds.\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

Prices started at 2 ETH (currently $3,700) for Tier 1 plots, 6 ETH ($11,100) for Tier 2, 20 ETH ($37,000) for Tier 3, and 80 ETH ($148,000) for Tier 4.\n\nIlluvium took in more than $72 million during the sale. The creators, according to a tweet, said that some 4,018 ETH (over $7.4 million today) will be redistributed to holders of the game's ILV token that have it staked. Meanwhile, 239,388 of the game\u2019s sILV2 token (about $22 million worth) will be burned or permanently destroyed, thus reducing the total supply.\n\"Inflation bad, deflation good,\" reads an official explainer regarding the planned burn.\nVirtual land sales have generated hundreds of millions of dollars for blockchain-based metaverse games like The Sandbox and Decentraland. A report from MetaMetric Solutions claimed that some $501 million worth of virtual land was sold throughout 2021, with another $85 million in January 2022 alone.\n\nIlluvium\u2019s land sale isn\u2019t quite a record\u2014fellow Ethereum-based game Ember Sword had a $203 million sale last July\u2014but it\u2019s notable due to the current bear market for NFTs, which have suffered alongside crypto markets.\nLeading NFT marketplace OpenSea has seen daily trading volumes in the $25 million to $40 million range of late, following a record-setting single day of $476 million on May 1, while top projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club have seen sinking valuations.\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

(Photo: Jason Nelson)Create an account to save your articles.A new art installation co-founded by prominent NFT photographer Justin Aversano has opened its doors on the iconic Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, California. Quantum Space LA is the latest in a growing trend of physical NFT galleries, in which artists can showcase their digital work in a real-world setting.\u00a0\nAversano, known for the in-demand Twin Flames NFT photography collection, used the grand opening of Quantum Space LA on Friday to launch his newest project, Doppelg\u00e4nger, a collection of 1,000 outtakes from Twin Flames. It continues Aversano's theme of photographing twins and turning those images into collectible NFT assets.\nNFTs are cryptographically unique tokens linked to digital and sometimes physical content, providing proof of ownership, membership to an exclusive club, or other potential perks. They are often used to represent digital goods such as photos, illustrations, and collectibles.\n\nQuantum Art is a photography-centric NFT platform that Aversano co-founded last fall. In February, the platform raised $7.5 million in funding. The Santa Monica space was announced in April ahead of its grand opening this weekend.\nLarge flat-screen televisions line the walls throughout the location, displaying images from various digital artists who have partnered with the startup to showcase and sell their work. Photos of twin siblings taken by Aversano all around the world are projected onto large hanging curtains in the center of the space.\n\"Twin Flames basically gave birth to Quantum. The success of Twin Flames, the community around Twin Flames, pushed me to support other photographers,\" Aversano told Decrypt at Friday\u2019s opening event.\n\nAversano said that the Santa Monica space is an experiment; the next opening is planned for this fall in New York, with hopes to launch similar installations worldwide.\"We plan to open one a month next year,\" Aversano said. \"We want to have 20 to 50 spaces around the world.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI'm thrilled and really interested to see how it kind of plays out, and how we could potentially change the narrative of \u2018NFTs are bad\u2019 and \u2018NFTs are not eco-friendly,\u2019\u201d said UnicornDAO\u2019s Rebecca Lamis, who also manages Quantum Space LA. \u201cI think there's a lot of impact we can do in that capacity.\u201d\nLamis said that the June 3rd opening was a soft launch of the space, but passersby appeared to be immediately interested, clamoring to come into the space to find out what it was all about.\nAs Aversano explained, the Quantum Spaces are paid for with the money raised from selling NFT minting keys ahead of time. The Quantum Keys were minted in March for the LA location, and now start at 4.15 ETH ($7,700) on secondary marketplaces. NFT holders gain access to an exclusive area of the gallery, and can use the venue to host events.\n\"We have enough treasury funding to work with artists and commission them to do mints,\" Aversano told Decrypt. He added that each future Quantum Space location will mint its own NFT collection to ensure that each location is unique and has its own membership group.\nAversano explained that Quantum is not just about him, but about also enabling other artists and creators through his own prosperity. \"I was able to uplift other artists with my success, which is what I love to do,\" he said. \u201cAnd I want to share the abundance, because that's what being an artist and a good person is about\u2014to share the wealth.\"\nWhile Quantum Art was founded with an initial focus on photography, the platform will branch out to encompass other types of artwork. Aversano said that it could include contributions from sculptors, painters, digital artists, fashion designers, and others building the nascent metaverse.\n\"We want to put up quality art, with a quality community of people that get together and thrive off each other, and support each other,\" Aversano said.\n\"I think that's why IRL spaces are important. Especially after a pandemic, we want it even more,\" he added. \"Quantum is in the perfect position to build these community hubs around the world.\"\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

The exchange calls it a \"woefully misinformed op-ed.\"\nBy Stacy ElliottJun 6, 2022Jun 6, 20224 min readBinance is one of the world's biggest crypto exchanges. Image: ShutterstockCreate an account to save your articles.A new report from Reuters estimates that at least $2.35 billion in illicit funds have been laundered through Binance between 2017 and 2021.\u00a0\nThe news agency analyzed court records, spoke with law enforcement, and worked with blockchain analysis firms Chainalysis and Crystal Blockchain to track illicit funds on the exchange.\nAs of Monday morning, Binance was the largest crypto exchange, accounting for $10.5 billion in spot and $41.4 billion in derivatives volume over the last day, according to CoinMarketCap.\u00a0\nThe report quotes Binance Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillman, who told Reuters that he did not believe its analysis was accurate.\u00a0\nHe did tell the news agency that the company was in the process of assembling \"the most sophisticated cyber forensics team on the planet\" that would \"further improve our ability to detect illegal crypto activity on our platform.\"\nA Binance spokesperson shared a response to the article with Decrypt, saying that the company has received \"an outpouring of support from partners in law enforcement across the globe\" since the article was published on Monday morning.\n\"We're aware of Angus Berwick's latest woefully misinformed op-ed,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"It should be noted that the article uses outdated information from 2019 and unverified personal attestations as a crutch to establish a false narrative.\"\nThe report connects several notable events and platforms, including the hack of a Slovakian crypto exchange Eterbase, darknet marketplace Hydra, and the North Korean hacking group Lazarus, each of which involved Binance to facilitate various crypto transactions.\nEterbase\nIn September 2020, attackers from the Lazarus group created anonymous Binance accounts and used them to launder a portion of $5.4 million stolen from Slovakian cryptocurrency exchange Eterbase, according to the Reuters analysis.\n\"Binance had no idea who was moving money through their exchange,\" said Eterbase co-founder Robert Auxt.\u00a0\nAfter the hack, Eterbase sought to work with Binance to recover the stolen funds. On September 9, 2020, Reuters reported that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that the exchange would \"do what we can to assist\" Eterbase.\n\nEmails shared with Reuters reportedly show that Binance declined to share information or account data without a request from law enforcement.\u00a0\nEterbase eventually shut down its exchange and eventually filed for bankruptcy.\nThe company filed a criminal complaint with Slovakia's National Crime Agency (NCA) in June 2021. After the NCA sent two requests to Binance, according to the report, the exchange sent records for 24 accounts that were linked to usernames like \"benjaminfranklin\" and \"garathbale.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nHydra\nThe Reuters report also estimates that Russian-language darknet site Hydra used Binance\u00a0to process payments for drugs totaling $780 million.\u00a0\u00a0\nHillman told Reuters that the total was \"inaccurate and overblown.\"\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Justice Department announced that it had cooperated with German law enforcement to seize Hydra's servers. At the time, the DOJ estimated that Hydra was responsible for 80% of all darknet crypto transactions and that it had received $5.2 billion since 2015.\n\nPosts reviewed by Reuters from Hydra show that in March 2018, Binance was the preferred way to process payments because of the minimal identifying information required to create an account.\n\"This is the fastest and cheapest way I've tried,\" one user wrote, according to Reuters.\n\nLazarus Attacks\nThe report frequently mentions Lazarus, a group of hackers that U.S. law enforcement has said uses its ill-gotten gains to fund North Korea's nuclear weapons program. As a result, the U.S. sanctioned Lazarus in 2019.\u00a0\nChainalysis, which worked with Reuters on the report, estimates that the group had stolen crypto worth $1.75 billion by 2020.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Lazarus used Binance to launder money from the $5.4 million Eterbase attack in 2020 too, and the $622 million attack on the Ronin sidechain that connects Axie Infinity to the Ethereum network.\nHilman told Reuters that Binance has identified and frozen more than $5 million connected to the Ronin sidechain hack. He also said that the exchange continues to work with law enforcement agencies in the investigation.\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

KellyJun 6, 2022Jun 6, 20223 min readTesla CEO Elon Musk. Image: ShutterstockCreate an account to save your articles.The latest chapter of Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition may be the saga's last: A new letter to Twitter's general counsel alleges that the company hasn't met its obligations in closing the deal.\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO said he's been eager to gather precise data on spam and bot activity on the platform. In May, Musk said that the $44 billion acquisition was \"temporarily on hold\" until he could verify that fewer than 5% of Twitter users were fake.\u00a0\nBut, according to Musk's counsel, Twitter has only ever provided details about its methodology for measuring such activity, not exactly how much of it occurs.\n\"Twitter's latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company's own testing methodologies, whether through written materials or verbal explanations, is tantamount to refusing Mr. Musk's data requests,\" reads the letter prepared by Musk's attorneys.\u00a0\nIt continues by stating that Musk doesn't find these methodologies \"adequate\" and that he \"must conduct his own analysis.\"\nPerhaps most important, however, this tussle has been deemed a \"clear material breach\" of the two parties' merger agreement and gives Musk the right \"to terminate the merger agreement\" altogether.\u00a0\n\n\"Breach of agreement\"\nRead: I made a stupid deal, but rules/laws don't apply to me.\n\u2014 Scott Galloway (@profgalloway) June 6, 2022\n\nTwitter shares are down about 3.4% to $38.81 as of this writing.\nIf the deal falls through, the social media platform may never see a host of crypto-infused upgrades Musk has hinted at since the deal began gaining traction.\n\nCrypto integration\nBesides becoming crypto Twitterati's poster boy, Musk does actually have a few ideas about how to integrate Web3 technology into the platform.\n\nFor starters, he'd look to tackle scams. \"If I had a Dogecoin for every crypto scam I see, I'd have 100 billion Dogecoins,\" he said in a recent interview.\u00a0\nHe's also suggested using Dogecoin (or potentially another cryptocurrency) as a payment option for Twitter's premium Blue membership.\u00a0\n\nTurning to crypto for payments has been a common thread running through Musk's plans. When discussing the potential of turning Twitter into a WeChat-esque \"super app,\" he noted that crypto payments could be one such feature.\nTwitter has yet to comment publicly, but already several business and media experts have weighed in.\nStephanie Ruhle of\u00a0MSNBC\u00a0reminded\u00a0Twitter followers that Musk \"waived the right to due diligence in the merger agreement,\" meaning that it should be much harder for him to exit the deal.\nMeanwhile, Brian Quinn, a Boston College law professor,\u00a0indicated\u00a0that today's news shows that Musk wants out \"or something that will get leverage for a renegotiation of the price.\"\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

The range for borrowing DAI using Ethereum is between 130% and 170%.\u00a0\nThe collateral backing USDD includes 14,040.6 Bitcoin, 240 million USDT, and approximately 1.9 billion Tron (TRX), the native token of the Tron ecosystem.\u00a0\nThe backing can be verified using signatures on block explorers.\u00a0\nCollateral backing USDD. Source: Tron DAO.\n\u201cCongratulations to USDD on becoming the first over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin!\u201d tweeted Justin Sun, the creator of USDD. \"A total of $1.37 billion of assets are backing the 667 million USDD in circulation.\u201d\nTron (TRX), the native token of the Tron ecosystem, is up 5.21% over the past 24 hours and is changing hands at $0.084 apiece according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nWhat is USDD?\nLaunched on May 5, USDD is extremely similar to Terra\u2019s stablecoin UST, an algorithmic stablecoin governed by smart contracts without any collateral backing.\u00a0\nLast month UST crashed wiping out approximately $60 billion in investor wealth in a week\u2019s time. Since then, algorithmic stablecoins have been heavily criticized, including USDD.\n\nUSDD\u2019s dollar peg is governed by smart contract-based arbitrage algorithms between USDD and Tron.\nInvestors can always swap 1 USDD for $1 worth of TRX if the price of USDD trades above the dollar peg. By selling the newly-minted TRX, users can pocket arbitrage profits for keeping the coin at its dollar-peg, and vice-versa.\nThis same algorithm proved inefficient with UST, however.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also the key reason that the Tron DAO has opted to change how its stablecoin operates.\n\u201cThis has been in the plan, but Terra/Luna definitely accelerated and prioritized this for our team\u201d tweeted Justin Sun, the creator of USDD. \u201cWe want to have USDD to be overcollateralized.\u201d\nNow, USDD has combined bits of collateralized stablecoins as well as algorithms to maintain its dollar peg.\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?
