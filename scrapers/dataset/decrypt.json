(Photo: Jason Nelson)Create an account to save your articles.A new art installation co-founded by prominent NFT photographer Justin Aversano has opened its doors on the iconic Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, California. Quantum Space LA is the latest in a growing trend of physical NFT galleries, in which artists can showcase their digital work in a real-world setting.\u00a0\nAversano, known for the in-demand Twin Flames NFT photography collection, used the grand opening of Quantum Space LA on Friday to launch his newest project, Doppelg\u00e4nger, a collection of 1,000 outtakes from Twin Flames. It continues Aversano's theme of photographing twins and turning those images into collectible NFT assets.\nNFTs are cryptographically unique tokens linked to digital and sometimes physical content, providing proof of ownership, membership to an exclusive club, or other potential perks. They are often used to represent digital goods such as photos, illustrations, and collectibles.\n\nQuantum Art is a photography-centric NFT platform that Aversano co-founded last fall. In February, the platform raised $7.5 million in funding. The Santa Monica space was announced in April ahead of its grand opening this weekend.\nLarge flat-screen televisions line the walls throughout the location, displaying images from various digital artists who have partnered with the startup to showcase and sell their work. Photos of twin siblings taken by Aversano all around the world are projected onto large hanging curtains in the center of the space.\n\"Twin Flames basically gave birth to Quantum. The success of Twin Flames, the community around Twin Flames, pushed me to support other photographers,\" Aversano told Decrypt at Friday\u2019s opening event.\n\nAversano said that the Santa Monica space is an experiment; the next opening is planned for this fall in New York, with hopes to launch similar installations worldwide.\"We plan to open one a month next year,\" Aversano said. \"We want to have 20 to 50 spaces around the world.\"\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI'm thrilled and really interested to see how it kind of plays out, and how we could potentially change the narrative of \u2018NFTs are bad\u2019 and \u2018NFTs are not eco-friendly,\u2019\u201d said UnicornDAO\u2019s Rebecca Lamis, who also manages Quantum Space LA. \u201cI think there's a lot of impact we can do in that capacity.\u201d\nLamis said that the June 3rd opening was a soft launch of the space, but passersby appeared to be immediately interested, clamoring to come into the space to find out what it was all about.\nAs Aversano explained, the Quantum Spaces are paid for with the money raised from selling NFT minting keys ahead of time. The Quantum Keys were minted in March for the LA location, and now start at 4.15 ETH ($7,700) on secondary marketplaces. NFT holders gain access to an exclusive area of the gallery, and can use the venue to host events.\n\"We have enough treasury funding to work with artists and commission them to do mints,\" Aversano told Decrypt. He added that each future Quantum Space location will mint its own NFT collection to ensure that each location is unique and has its own membership group.\nAversano explained that Quantum is not just about him, but about also enabling other artists and creators through his own prosperity. \"I was able to uplift other artists with my success, which is what I love to do,\" he said. \u201cAnd I want to share the abundance, because that's what being an artist and a good person is about\u2014to share the wealth.\"\nWhile Quantum Art was founded with an initial focus on photography, the platform will branch out to encompass other types of artwork. Aversano said that it could include contributions from sculptors, painters, digital artists, fashion designers, and others building the nascent metaverse.\n\"We want to put up quality art, with a quality community of people that get together and thrive off each other, and support each other,\" Aversano said.\n\"I think that's why IRL spaces are important. Especially after a pandemic, we want it even more,\" he added. \"Quantum is in the perfect position to build these community hubs around the world.\"\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

The exchange calls it a \"woefully misinformed op-ed.\"\nBy Stacy ElliottJun 6, 2022Jun 6, 20224 min readBinance is one of the world's biggest crypto exchanges. Image: ShutterstockCreate an account to save your articles.A new report from Reuters estimates that at least $2.35 billion in illicit funds have been laundered through Binance between 2017 and 2021.\u00a0\nThe news agency analyzed court records, spoke with law enforcement, and worked with blockchain analysis firms Chainalysis and Crystal Blockchain to track illicit funds on the exchange.\nAs of Monday morning, Binance was the largest crypto exchange, accounting for $10.5 billion in spot and $41.4 billion in derivatives volume over the last day, according to CoinMarketCap.\u00a0\nThe report quotes Binance Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillman, who told Reuters that he did not believe its analysis was accurate.\u00a0\nHe did tell the news agency that the company was in the process of assembling \"the most sophisticated cyber forensics team on the planet\" that would \"further improve our ability to detect illegal crypto activity on our platform.\"\nA Binance spokesperson shared a response to the article with Decrypt, saying that the company has received \"an outpouring of support from partners in law enforcement across the globe\" since the article was published on Monday morning.\n\"We're aware of Angus Berwick's latest woefully misinformed op-ed,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"It should be noted that the article uses outdated information from 2019 and unverified personal attestations as a crutch to establish a false narrative.\"\nThe report connects several notable events and platforms, including the hack of a Slovakian crypto exchange Eterbase, darknet marketplace Hydra, and the North Korean hacking group Lazarus, each of which involved Binance to facilitate various crypto transactions.\nEterbase\nIn September 2020, attackers from the Lazarus group created anonymous Binance accounts and used them to launder a portion of $5.4 million stolen from Slovakian cryptocurrency exchange Eterbase, according to the Reuters analysis.\n\"Binance had no idea who was moving money through their exchange,\" said Eterbase co-founder Robert Auxt.\u00a0\nAfter the hack, Eterbase sought to work with Binance to recover the stolen funds. On September 9, 2020, Reuters reported that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that the exchange would \"do what we can to assist\" Eterbase.\n\nEmails shared with Reuters reportedly show that Binance declined to share information or account data without a request from law enforcement.\u00a0\nEterbase eventually shut down its exchange and eventually filed for bankruptcy.\nThe company filed a criminal complaint with Slovakia's National Crime Agency (NCA) in June 2021. After the NCA sent two requests to Binance, according to the report, the exchange sent records for 24 accounts that were linked to usernames like \"benjaminfranklin\" and \"garathbale.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nHydra\nThe Reuters report also estimates that Russian-language darknet site Hydra used Binance\u00a0to process payments for drugs totaling $780 million.\u00a0\u00a0\nHillman told Reuters that the total was \"inaccurate and overblown.\"\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Justice Department announced that it had cooperated with German law enforcement to seize Hydra's servers. At the time, the DOJ estimated that Hydra was responsible for 80% of all darknet crypto transactions and that it had received $5.2 billion since 2015.\n\nPosts reviewed by Reuters from Hydra show that in March 2018, Binance was the preferred way to process payments because of the minimal identifying information required to create an account.\n\"This is the fastest and cheapest way I've tried,\" one user wrote, according to Reuters.\n\nLazarus Attacks\nThe report frequently mentions Lazarus, a group of hackers that U.S. law enforcement has said uses its ill-gotten gains to fund North Korea's nuclear weapons program. As a result, the U.S. sanctioned Lazarus in 2019.\u00a0\nChainalysis, which worked with Reuters on the report, estimates that the group had stolen crypto worth $1.75 billion by 2020.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Lazarus used Binance to launder money from the $5.4 million Eterbase attack in 2020 too, and the $622 million attack on the Ronin sidechain that connects Axie Infinity to the Ethereum network.\nHilman told Reuters that Binance has identified and frozen more than $5 million connected to the Ronin sidechain hack. He also said that the exchange continues to work with law enforcement agencies in the investigation.\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

KellyJun 6, 2022Jun 6, 20223 min readTesla CEO Elon Musk. Image: ShutterstockCreate an account to save your articles.The latest chapter of Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition may be the saga's last: A new letter to Twitter's general counsel alleges that the company hasn't met its obligations in closing the deal.\nThe Tesla and SpaceX CEO said he's been eager to gather precise data on spam and bot activity on the platform. In May, Musk said that the $44 billion acquisition was \"temporarily on hold\" until he could verify that fewer than 5% of Twitter users were fake.\u00a0\nBut, according to Musk's counsel, Twitter has only ever provided details about its methodology for measuring such activity, not exactly how much of it occurs.\n\"Twitter's latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company's own testing methodologies, whether through written materials or verbal explanations, is tantamount to refusing Mr. Musk's data requests,\" reads the letter prepared by Musk's attorneys.\u00a0\nIt continues by stating that Musk doesn't find these methodologies \"adequate\" and that he \"must conduct his own analysis.\"\nPerhaps most important, however, this tussle has been deemed a \"clear material breach\" of the two parties' merger agreement and gives Musk the right \"to terminate the merger agreement\" altogether.\u00a0\n\n\"Breach of agreement\"\nRead: I made a stupid deal, but rules/laws don't apply to me.\n\u2014 Scott Galloway (@profgalloway) June 6, 2022\n\nTwitter shares are down about 3.4% to $38.81 as of this writing.\nIf the deal falls through, the social media platform may never see a host of crypto-infused upgrades Musk has hinted at since the deal began gaining traction.\n\nCrypto integration\nBesides becoming crypto Twitterati's poster boy, Musk does actually have a few ideas about how to integrate Web3 technology into the platform.\n\nFor starters, he'd look to tackle scams. \"If I had a Dogecoin for every crypto scam I see, I'd have 100 billion Dogecoins,\" he said in a recent interview.\u00a0\nHe's also suggested using Dogecoin (or potentially another cryptocurrency) as a payment option for Twitter's premium Blue membership.\u00a0\n\nTurning to crypto for payments has been a common thread running through Musk's plans. When discussing the potential of turning Twitter into a WeChat-esque \"super app,\" he noted that crypto payments could be one such feature.\nTwitter has yet to comment publicly, but already several business and media experts have weighed in.\nStephanie Ruhle of\u00a0MSNBC\u00a0reminded\u00a0Twitter followers that Musk \"waived the right to due diligence in the merger agreement,\" meaning that it should be much harder for him to exit the deal.\nMeanwhile, Brian Quinn, a Boston College law professor,\u00a0indicated\u00a0that today's news shows that Musk wants out \"or something that will get leverage for a renegotiation of the price.\"\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

The range for borrowing DAI using Ethereum is between 130% and 170%.\u00a0\nThe collateral backing USDD includes 14,040.6 Bitcoin, 240 million USDT, and approximately 1.9 billion Tron (TRX), the native token of the Tron ecosystem.\u00a0\nThe backing can be verified using signatures on block explorers.\u00a0\nCollateral backing USDD. Source: Tron DAO.\n\u201cCongratulations to USDD on becoming the first over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin!\u201d tweeted Justin Sun, the creator of USDD. \"A total of $1.37 billion of assets are backing the 667 million USDD in circulation.\u201d\nTron (TRX), the native token of the Tron ecosystem, is up 5.21% over the past 24 hours and is changing hands at $0.084 apiece according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n\nWhat is USDD?\nLaunched on May 5, USDD is extremely similar to Terra\u2019s stablecoin UST, an algorithmic stablecoin governed by smart contracts without any collateral backing.\u00a0\nLast month UST crashed wiping out approximately $60 billion in investor wealth in a week\u2019s time. Since then, algorithmic stablecoins have been heavily criticized, including USDD.\n\nUSDD\u2019s dollar peg is governed by smart contract-based arbitrage algorithms between USDD and Tron.\nInvestors can always swap 1 USDD for $1 worth of TRX if the price of USDD trades above the dollar peg. By selling the newly-minted TRX, users can pocket arbitrage profits for keeping the coin at its dollar-peg, and vice-versa.\nThis same algorithm proved inefficient with UST, however.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also the key reason that the Tron DAO has opted to change how its stablecoin operates.\n\u201cThis has been in the plan, but Terra/Luna definitely accelerated and prioritized this for our team\u201d tweeted Justin Sun, the creator of USDD. \u201cWe want to have USDD to be overcollateralized.\u201d\nNow, USDD has combined bits of collateralized stablecoins as well as algorithms to maintain its dollar peg.\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

Rival marketplace Steam has banned NFT games.\nWhen leading PC gaming marketplace Steam decided to ban Web3 games with NFT or crypto hooks last October, rising rival Epic Games Store claimed that it would remain open to such games. \nAnd now we know which game will be the first Web3 title to appear on Epic's platform.\nToday, Gala Games announced that its Wild West-themed battle royale shooter GRIT would be the first NFT-powered game to launch via the Epic Games Store. GRIT will be a free-to-play online multiplayer game for Windows PC players, and it will feature user-owned NFT assets that can be purchased, resold, and utilized within the game.\nAn NFT is a blockchain token that proves ownership of various items and is often used for digital goods such as artwork, collectibles, and in-game assets for video games. Gaming examples include avatars, vehicles, weapons, apparel, and virtual land plots.\nA screenshot from the game GRIT. Image: Gala Games.\nGala will release 10,000 player avatars for GRIT, offering a unique look and customization elements to owners. The firm will offer the avatars via a \"Gunslinger's Box\" sale, which begins this week at the publisher's Galaverse event in Malta.\nGRIT looks to be a Fortnite-like experience with a large number of players dropped into a free-for-all battle to the death, albeit with a distinctive Western aesthetic. It's due out later in 2022 and runs on Epic Games' own Unreal Engine. \nGala Games' press release suggests that GRIT won't be the company's only game to launch on the Epic Games Store.\n\n\"Epic is a pioneer and visionary in the video game industry. Gala Games' titles being available on the Epic Game Store brings legitimacy to this new genre of gaming,\" said John Osvald, Gala's president of games, in a release. \"Easy access to Web3 games is a turning point for those players who have not yet seen how digital ownership can enrich the gaming experience.\"\nGala Games has quickly become a prominent player in the blockchain gaming space, enlisting veteran game developers like Will Wright (The Sims) and Peter Molyneux (Fable) to create NFT-enhanced games while also signing NFT-savvy celebs like Snoop Dogg and Steve Aoki. \nThe GALA token, currently priced below $0.08, has a total market cap of $555 million, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nCrypto finds home with Epic Games\nEpic Games is not only the company behind the Epic Games Store and Unreal Engine but is also the developer of the leading battle royale shooter, Fortnite. The Epic Games Store had 194 million total users as of the end of 2021, making it a sizable launchpad for Gala and GRIT.\nValve's Steam marketplace is currently the leading PC gaming platform, and it took a hard stance against games with NFTs or crypto tokens last October when it barred such games from launching on the platform. \nIn response, Epic Games co-founder and CEO Tim Sweeney tweeted a welcome message to creators of such games.\n\"Epic Games Store will welcome games that make use of blockchain tech provided they follow the relevant laws, disclose their terms, and are age-rated by an appropriate group,\" he wrote. \"Though Epic's not using crypto in our games, we welcome innovation in the areas of technology and finance.\"\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

The Commission stressed that while the number of reports has slightly reduced, the reported amount of losses\u2014on the contrary\u2014has increased, indicating that on average people reported higher individual losses.\n\u201cWe are seeing more money lost to investment scams and so are urging all Australians not to trust investment opportunities that seem too good to be true,\u201d said Rickard.\n\nScammers turn to crypto\nEarlier this year, the ACCC already pointed to a significant uptick in investment scams, also noting that cryptocurrencies have overtaken traditional bank payments in frequency.\n\u201cWe see a number of scams relating to investment schemes, and we are now seeing that the payments in relation to those are now more often by way of cryptocurrency than by way of bank transfer,\u201d ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said at the time.\n\nThe ACCC\u2019s latest warning comes hot on the heels of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2019s latest report saying that more than 46,000 Americans have also lost over a combined $1 billion in crypto-related scams since the beginning of last year.\nWhile approximately $680 million in losses were reported in 2021, as much as $329 million was reported in the first quarter of 2022 alone, meaning that this year\u2019s figures are likely to be much higher.\nBitcoin (70%), Tether (10%), and Ethereum (9%) were reportedly the most frequently stolen cryptocurrencies, according to the report.\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

Image: Shutterstock. Create an account to save your articles.Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt\nThe two most striking conversations this week on the world's largest microblogging platform were Elon Musk's beef with Dogecoin co-creator Jackson Palmer, and Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin's musings on a letter sent to Washington by crypto skeptics.\nOn Monday, Australian news outlet Crikey published an interview with Palmer, who was promoting his new podcast, Griftonomics, when he laid into the crypto industry.\n\"I wish it was the end of crypto, but it's not,\" Palmer said, before turning his thoughts to Musk: \"He's a grifter. He sells a vision in hopes that he can one day deliver what he's promising, but he doesn't know that. He's just really good at pretending he knows.\"\nPalmer also said that he wrote a Python script that would automatically detect and report spam bots in a Twitter user's mentions. The Dogecoin-loving Musk allegedly reached out to Palmer and asked for the script, but, according to Palmer: \"It became apparent very quickly that he didn't understand coding as well as he made out. He asked, 'How do I run this Python script?'\"\n\nYou falsely claimed ur lame snippet of Python gets rid of bots. Ok buddy, then share it with the world \u2026\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2022\n\nThe Tesla CEO responded by saying his children wrote better code than Palmer. Musk also called Palmer \"a tool.\"\n\nMy kids wrote better code when they were 12 than the nonsense script Jackson sent me. \nLike I said, if it\u2019s so great, he should share it with the world and make everyone\u2019s experience with Twitter better. If he does, you will see what I mean.\nJackson Palmer is a tool.\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 31, 2022\n\nPalmer didn't reply directly to Musk's provocations, but he defended his spambot catcher in a subsequent mini-thread.\n\nI never said it was super complex, but this simple script definitely worked in catching and reporting the less sophisticated phishing accounts circa 2018... They've since evolved their tactics.\nI shared it with a lot of people, and it worked for them. https://t.co/iKPFsYHXEG\n\u2014 Jackson Palmer (@ummjackson) May 31, 2022\n\nOn Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that a letter signed by 26 anti-crypto computer scientists, tech bloggers, and academics, including many former FAANG employees, had been presented to U.S. lawmakers.\nThe letter urges regulators to \"take a critical, skeptical approach toward industry claims that crypto-assets are an innovative technology that is unreservedly good,\" and it asked them to \"resist pressure from digital asset industry financiers, lobbyists, and boosters.\"\nEthereum creator Vitalik Buterin appeared to respond to the letter in a tweet thread on Friday.\n\nA big difference between the \"new idealistic movement\" scene 10-15 years ago vs today is that back then it felt possible to be on all the good-guy teams at the same time. Today, much more adversarial thinking and conflict.\nI've been trying to understand.. where to from here?\n\u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 2, 2022\n\nButerin also stated that crypto fans were upset and confused that British-Canadian tech blogger Cory Doctorow was a signatory to the letter, because they\u2019d considered him an ally. In 2018, Doctorow delivered a keynote speech called \u201cDecentralize, Democratize, or Die\u201d at DevCon, the annual Ethereum developer conference.\n\nAs Cory mentioned, crypto was at first just decentralization enthusiasts, but now there's also various types of \"money people\".\nThis is an inevitable part of becoming bigger. In non-financial movements too, various classes of normies and often soon grifters move in over time.\n\u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 2, 2022\n\nButerin also mentioned that he's unhappy with the amount of infighting in the crypto community. He suggested it was a byproduct of success, because as businesses scale up they find themselves in more direct competition with each other.\n\nOne important factor is that all of those movements *got much bigger* in the last decade. When something is small, even if you don't like it, it's not a threat, so it's easy to live-and-let-live. When everything is big, more competition, so more incentive to point out problems.\n\u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 2, 2022\n\n\nI guess the conclusion is, peacekeeping and cooperation-seeking needs to be an explicit effort rather than peace being an assumed default.\n\u2014 vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) June 2, 2022\n\nElsewhere\nLachlan Markay of Axios provided a pithy account of how Rep.
