With a total circulating supply of nearly 700 million, the TRON-based USDD has recently upgraded itself to the first over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin (OCDS), offering faster transactions with the highest collateral ratio around the globe.\nAs one of the most secure decentralized stablecoins, USDD enjoys a guaranteed collateral ratio of at least 130%, higher than the 120% set by DAI, which is considered a paragon of the industry. The real-time collateral ratio of USDD is published on the TRON DAO Reserve\u2019s website, publicly available 24/7.\nWhile allowing the TRON DAO Reserve members to continue minting USDD by burning TRX, the upgrade consolidates USDD\u2019s stability and credibility by over-collateralizing assets under the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR). These reserve assets would include BTC, TRX, and multiple stablecoins like USDC, USDT, TUSD, and USDJ, at a ratio of 130% to back the issuance of USDD. In other words, every USDD is supported by at least $1.3 worth of BTC, TRX, stablecoins, and potentially other highly liquid assets.\nThe TRON DAO Reserve is currently holding 10,500 BTC, 240 million USDT, and 1.9 billion TRX in the reserve account, on top of the 8.29 billion TRX already in the burning contract. The real-time collateral ratio is now over 200% \u2013 a total $1.37 billion of assets backing the 667 million USDD in circulation.\n\u201cSpearheading the Stablecoin 3.0 era, the upgraded, over-collateralized USDD will add more diversified features to underpin its stability,\u201d said H.E. Justin Sun, Founder of TRON. \u201cThe $10 billion reserves pledged by the TDR will enable USDD to become the most reliable decentralized stablecoin with the highest collateral ratio in blockchain history. Currently, the 200%+ collateral ratio offers USDD a very strong safety net.\u201d\nTo power the over-collateralization of USDD, the TDR has greatly increased its reserves, including the highly liquid BTC, TRX, and USDT, to back USDD\u2019s total supply. Users worldwide can access the information by querying on-chain contracts at any time, and the collateral ratio is transparently maintained.\nStablecoins are the faucet of the blockchain industry, and it\u2019s critical to ensure their security, transparency, efficiency, affordability, and scale, all of which criteria make USDD a highly desirable option. This upgrade has strengthened USDD, adding an extra layer of security to the token\u2019s stability and risk tolerance in a way similar to how Maker powers DAI.\nThe DAI token, supported by Maker, is one of the oldest and most resilient stablecoins in the DeFi field. Its success is an excellent example of the decentralization of stablecoins. USDD runs on TRON, one of the largest stablecoin networks. Millions of TRON users, as well as those leveraging the BTTC cross-chain solution, are experiencing the complete decentralization of stablecoins, which in turn shows how blockchain technology practically reaches the masses.\nSo far, USDD has been circulating on TRON, Ethereum, and BNB Chain. It\u2019s also embraced by numerous popular platforms, including SUN.io, Uniswap, PancakeSwap, Curve, Ellipsis, KyberSwap, Poloniex, Huobi Global, KuCoin, Gate.io, and Bybit. Industry leaders such as Alameda Research, Amber Group, Poloniex, Ankr, Mirana, Multichain, FalconX, and TPS Capital have already joined the TDR membership as a whitelisted institution, with more names soon to be announced.\nIn addition, behind the TRON blockchain, thrives a vibrant community led by the TRON DAO, one of the largest DAOs in the world. As of June 2022, TRON has registered over 96 million user accounts, over $55 billion worth of assets stored on-chain, and an average daily transaction value of $10 billion across the network.\nIn the near future, the TRON-based USDD will quickly embrace additional ecosystems and major applications. USDD will lead the way into a new era for stablecoins as it grows in supply and user adoption, ushering in the next stage of decentralization across the blockchain industry worldwide.\nAbout TRON DAO\nTRON is dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps). Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users.\u00a0\nThe TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of June 2022, it has over 96 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 3.2 billion total transactions, and over $12.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether stablecoin (USDT) across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. \nTRON is also currently the third largest blockchain hosting the USD Coin (USDC) created by Circle. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. Most recently, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry, the TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON\u2019s official entry into decentralized stablecoins.\nMedia Contact\nFeroz Lakhani\npress@tron.network\nDisclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp Next\nRankerDao announces $100,000$+ buy back & burn streak of $RANKER in June\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss\nSolana: Mapping out profitable entry and exit triggers for SOL traders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAnjali Sriniwasan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Masters in Mass communication and journalism, Anjali's interests lie in blockchain technology adoption across emerging economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\nClick to comment\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

Blockchain-based digitization has taken currencies online, allowing us to make payments and transfer funds without ever touching them.\nBecause of inflation, the value of any currency will not be the same after five years. As a result, finding the correct investing strategy to protect against inflation is critical.\nGold, for example, has long been regarded as a buffer against inflation, and many people consider it an alternative currency.\nAs an investment, gold is a reliable and secure asset. There have been several revolutions in global markets, especially digital assets, as the digital world has progressed.\nHowever, because currencies are constantly prone to inflation, long-term \u2026Read the full article at Bitcoinist.comProductsBlockchain ExplorerCrypto APICrypto IndicesJobs BoardSitemapCompanyAbout usTerms of usePrivacy PolicyCommunity RulesDisclaimerMethodologyCareersWe\u2019re hiring!SupportRequest FormContact SupportFAQGlossarySocialsFacebookTwitterTelegramInstagramInteractive Chat\u00a9 2022 CoinMarketCap.

Surviving the crypto downturn\nLooking at the NXTT price chart, we see that it launched at around $0.001 in late January, and now sits at around $0.0034, and was recently at $0.004.\nIn the meantime, many other altcoins, particularly small-cap altcoins and ICO tokens, have seen their prices plummet by 80% or more.

This, despite the altcoin itself treading the abyss.\nIs Algorand heading up?\nAt the time of writing, Algorand was trading at $0.38. The last time the altcoin was at this level was 16 months ago, back in February 2021. \nIf this was the case with any other cryptocurrency, the network would see a decline in the presence of its holders. Algorand, however, might just be the exception to the rule.\u00a0\n Algorand price action  | Source: TradingView \u2013 AMBCrypto\nAccording to on-chain data, ALGO is somehow attracting more investors towards it. In fact, the network saw the arrival of 1.1 million new addresses in the week before the crash. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough these were new investors, for Algorand, this is a mere recovery as the network had already lost 10.6 million holders. This figure accounted for 65% of all ALGO addresses.\n Algorand investors  | Source: Intotheblock \u2013 AMBCrypto\nOver the same time period, there were activity spikes as well. Between 2 May and 8 May, for instance, over 350k investors were actively participating on-chain. \nThis was a 1,160% hike from the average figure of 28k, which also suddenly disappeared as the market crashed.\n Algorand active investors  | Source: Intotheblock \u2013 AMBCrypto\nDuring the crash, ALGO, along with the rest of the market, was also knocked down. Here, the altcoin ended up losing almost 52% of its value. However, it seems like as the tides are changing. Investors are also anticipating profits in the coming few weeks.\nAt the time of writing, more than 60k addresses were active on-chain, with the same rising since the end of May. Not only this, but holders are also actively accumulating as much ALGO as possible in preparation of the same. \nBuy orders for the asset exceeded the sell orders by a margin of 2 million ALGO ($600k).\n Algorand buy and sell orders  | Source: Intotheblock \u2013 AMBCrypto\nThese investors are probably expecting ALGO to recover its May losses and return to the prices before then and trade at $0.74. This can happen only when the altcoin marks a 92% rally (ref. Algorand price action).\nHowever, its high correlation of 0.89 with Bitcoin might act as a hurdle in this rally because if the king coin slips, it will drag down Algorand along with it. In doing so, it will crush its investors\u2019 hopes.\n Algorand correlation to Bitcoin  | Source: Intotheblock \u2013 AMBCrypto\n\n\n\n\nRead the best crypto stories of the day in less than 5 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get it daily in your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select your Email Preferences.\n\n\nThe Daily Digest\n\n\nThe Weekly Digest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRelated Topics:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss\nShould Dogecoin [DOGE] investors prepare for another selloff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAaryamann Shrivastava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaryamann is a freelance crypto journalist working with AMBCrypto.

exchange by trading volume, has raised $500 million for a fund that will invest in Web3 despite the current bear market.\nAccording to a report by CNBC published on June 1, Binance Labs, the venture capital arm of Binance, has \u201craised $500 million for its debut start-up fund, securing backing from venture capital firms DST Global and Breyer Capital as well as unnamed family offices and corporations.\u201d \nDespite the new funds appearing across the industry, the crypto markets appears to be entering a bear cycle. As noted in the report, Bitcoin has plunged more than 50% since reaching its all-time high near $69,000 last November. Coinbase, a leading U.S.-based exchange, has watched its shares decline 69% since the start of the year.\u00a0\nKen Li, Binance Labs\u2019 executive director of investments and M&A, told CNBC:\n\u201cWe are looking for projects with the potential to drive the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.\u201d\nCNBC\u2019s report pointed out that although Binance has \u201cmade a series of high-profile equity investments in the past year,\u201d this marks \u201cthe first time the company has formally raised a VC fund with financing from external investors.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm\u00a0Andreessen Horowitz\u00a0(\u201ca16z\u201d) announced on May 25 the launch of a $4.5 billion fund since they believe that \u201cwe are\u00a0now\u00a0entering the\u00a0golden era of web3.\u201d\nIn its blog post, a16z said:\n\u201cWe think we are\u00a0now\u00a0entering the\u00a0golden era of web3. Programmable blockchains are sufficiently advanced, and a diverse range of apps have reached tens of millions of users. More importantly, a massive wave of world-class talent has entered web3 over the last year. They are brilliant and passionate and want to build a better internet.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we decided to go big. We\u2019ve been investing in crypto since 2013, and today\u00a0we\u2019re announcing our fourth crypto fund, totaling $4.5B. Of that, approximately $1.5B will be dedicated to seed investments, and $3B to venture investments. This brings our total crypto/web3 funds raised to over $7.6B.\u201c\nNewsletter\nTo make sure you receive a\u00a0FREE weekly newsletter\u00a0that features highlights from our most popular stories,\u00a0click here.\nDisclaimer\nThe views and opinions expressed by the author, or any people mentioned in this article, are for informational purposes only, and they do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.

This came as the asset jumped to and beyond $30,000 in the past 12 hours.\nBTC\u2019s First Weekly Green Candle Since March\nIt was at the end of March when the landscape around the primary cryptocurrency seemed significantly more bullish. At that point, bitcoin had added over $10,000 in two weeks and looked primed to challenge the coveted $50,000 line. However, what followed was precisely the opposite.\nInstead of heading further north, BTC started retracing, sometimes more gradually, sometimes more violently. Weeks later, it equaled a negative record in terms of consecutive weekly candles closed in the red (6). However, the streak continued, and bitcoin saw its 9th such candle in a row last week.\nThe past seven days were more positive as BTC even spiked above $32,000 mid-week. Despite failing there and returning below $30,000, the cryptocurrency still managed to close the week above $29,250 (the closing price at the end of last week). As such, it saw its first weekly green candle since March 21st.\nJust hours after that, the situation took another turn for the better as BTC jumped above $30,000 and now sits even north of $31,000.\nBTCUSD. Source: TradingView\nIs the Worst Over?\nWith bitcoin losing over $20,000 in two months at one point, many community analysts started speculating on whether the asset had finally found its local bottom. The latest such discussions, as reported by CryptoPotato yesterday, touched upon the capitulation phase, which, according to CryptoQuant, has seen investors dumping large portions of their BTC holdings.\nThe analysts argued that the markets tend to bottom out in such conditions when investors have disposed of their assets, even at a loss. \u201cIn bear markets, long-term holders\u2019 capitulation usually marks a multi-year bottom,\u201d they added.\nNevertheless, CryptoQuant warned that this sell-off could take weeks or even months to finish and not be a one-time thing.\n\nSPECIAL OFFER (Sponsored)\nBinance Free $100 (Exclusive): Use this link to register and receive $100 free and 10% off fees on Binance Futures first month (terms).\nPrimeXBT Special Offer: Use this link to register & enter POTATO50 code to receive up to $7,000 on your deposits.\n\nTags: Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) Price\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnjoy reading?

In an interview with \u2018The Block\u2019 last week after appearing at CoinMarketCap\u2019s The Capital virtual conference, the MicroStrategy CEO said that investors should understand Bitcoin as a long-term investment.\nThe majority of investors fail to make money because they don\u2019t understand Bitcoin. Saylor said that Bitcoin\u2019s near-term volatility is largely irrelevant once investors understand the fundamentals of the flagship cryptocurrency. \nWhile Saylor suggested that people who have spent at least $100 on Bitcoin can speak about the crypto, he allowed that but indicated that such traders probably \u201cshouldn\u2019t have anything to say about it.\u201d\nAccording to the MicroStrategy CEO: \"Bitcoin is the most certain thing in a very uncertain world, it's more certain than the other 19,000 cryptocurrencies, it's more certain than any stock, it's more certain than owning property anywhere in the world.\u201d \nBitcoin is normally considered as almost three times more volatile than traditional investments (like stocks) in the short term. But Saylor thinks that the crypto volatility presents both risk and opportunity for financial investments.\nMost small investors fail to reap opportunities in Bitcoin trading because their trade is often based on short-term volatility. They are too pessimistic about downtrends, which eventually affects their decision-making. \nThe MicroStrategy CEO said that investors should keep a long-time horizon with respect to investing in Bitcoin.\nThe executive advised investors that they should not feel down that Bitcoin prices are well off their all-time highs.\nSeasonal investors don\u2019t take the risk of trading Bitcoin in the short term to increase their gains because their gains will be large enough to satisfy them if they wait long enough.\n\"My time horizon is a decade or more,\" Saylor said in February during an interview with Yahoo Finance Live.\nThe executive has been putting his money where his mouth is on Bitcoin.\nMicroStrategy bought 660 Bitcoins for about $25 million between December 2021 and January 2022 at an average price of $37,865 per coin. \nCurrently, the firm holds 125,051 Bitcoins valued at about $4.8 billion, which reflects Saylor's focus on diversifying the software firm into a promising technology.Image source: Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopied\n Michael Saylor MicroStrategy CEO Discusses Bitcoin as Competitive Tool for Firms, Sees Potential in Other Cryptos  \n\n\nBITCOIN VOLATILITY MICROSTRATEGY MICHAEL SAYLOR \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\nSubscribe now and get exclusive news, interviews and stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNFT \n\n\n\nHong Kong Startup BEAM+ LAB's Exhibition to Celebrate Launch of CRYPTYQUES NFT\n\nJun 06, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin \n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Short-Term Volatility Is Irrelevant Once Investors Understand Its Fundamentals, Says MicroStrategy CEO\n\nJun 06, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity \n\n\n\nCoinbase is Safest Crypto Exchange Overall: BrokerChooser\n\nJun 06, 2022\n| 3 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry Expert \n\n\n\nExperts Suggest Merely Tokens Might Survive after LUNA's Collapse\n\nJun 06, 2022\n| 3 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto News\n\nBitcoin News\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nEthereum News\nCardano News\nRipple News\nStablecoin News\nCBDC News\nDeFi News\nNFT News\n\n\n\nRegulatory News\n\nRegulation\nLegal\nCybercrime\n\n\n\nIndustry News\n\nExchanges\nMining\nData Service\n\n\n\nTechnology News\n\nEnterprise\nBlockchain Application\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nWrite For Us\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy\nTerms & Conditions\nAdvertise\nBlockchain Ecosystem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonetary & Financial Freedom\n\r\n                                With blockchain, we will put an end to the monopoly of government-issued currencies, as suggested in the title of Hayek\u2019s work \u2013 \u201cDenationalization of Money.\u201d Blockchain will simplify the set of concepts revolving around financial services and the complexity of the IT systems.

The exchange was also ranked as a tier 1 for other sub-categories.\nWhile FTX US Derivatives was second with a score of 4.0 and Bitstamp was third with a score of 3.8.\nBrokerChooser analysed the largest cryptocurrency exchanges on four main pillars: regulation, consumer protection, market fairness and transparency to reveal the safest exchanges for investors.\nIn terms of safest exchanges for regulation, FTX US Derivatives, Gemini and Kraken Futures shared the top spot with an overall score of 5 on a scale of 5, BrokerChooser revealed.\nThe research also revealed that the least safe exchange for regulation was Kucoin and Bybit, with an overall score of 1 each.\nIn the safest exchange for consumer protection category, Gemini led the table with a 4.8 score out of 5.\u00a0\nThe research revealed that Gemini has a high level of protection for both crypto and fiat holdings, and the exchange has not experienced a hacking incident in the last five years.\nThe least safe in the same category was OKX, with a score of 1, as the exchange has lacked in sharing information on how they protect either crypto or fiat holdings.\nThe company has also been a victim of two major hacks. In October 2017, around $3 million worth of crypto was stolen, with $5.6 million being taken in a separate incident in August 2020, BrokerChooser's research revealed.\nRegarding safest exchanges market fairness, FTX US Derivatives and Bittrex received a perfect score of 5 out of 5.\nThe main reason to support this score was their appropriate policies to restrict proprietary trading and employee trading, BrokerChooser stated.\nWhile OKX, Gate.io and Bybit were the least safe crypto exchanges in the same category with a score of 1 out of 5, respectively.\nThese exchanges have no credible data about measures in place against prop trading and employee trading or detailed coin listing criteria.\nAlong with the availability and use of untrustworthy stablecoins on their platform, these exchanges also issue their own utility tokens.\nTransparency is an important aspect of crypto exchange platforms as it helps ensure customers feel protected. Coinbase was again the leader of this category with an overall score of 4.8 out of 5.\nCoinbase's key attraction for customers has been their readily available information for the public regarding corporate structure, financial statements and legal documents, and having a relatively simple product offering, BrokerChooser research revealed.\nWhile in the same category, Binance, OKX, KuCoin, Gate.io, Bybit and Phemex were the least safe, with a total score of 1 out of 5, respectively, as they all offer limited or no information about their finances and products. Also, the information that they do offer is not credible or is too complex for the average consumer to understand, the research added.Image source: Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopied\n Coinbase to Revoke Job Offers Extended to Newly Employed Staff#https://blockchain.news/news/coinbase-to-revoke-job-offers-extended-to-newly-employed-staff;   \n\n\nBLOCKCHAIN CRYPTO CRYPTOCURRENY COINBASE BROKERCHOOSER \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike this post: \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRead More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\nSubscribe now and get exclusive news, interviews and stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNFT \n\n\n\nHong Kong Startup BEAM+ LAB's Exhibition to Celebrate Launch of CRYPTYQUES NFT\n\nJun 06, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin \n\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s Short-Term Volatility Is Irrelevant Once Investors Understand Its Fundamentals, Says MicroStrategy CEO\n\nJun 06, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCybersecurity \n\n\n\nCoinbase is Safest Crypto Exchange Overall: BrokerChooser\n\nJun 06, 2022\n| 3 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry Expert \n\n\n\nExperts Suggest Merely Tokens Might Survive after LUNA's Collapse\n\nJun 06, 2022\n| 3 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto News\n\nBitcoin News\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nEthereum News\nCardano News\nRipple News\nStablecoin News\nCBDC News\nDeFi News\nNFT News\n\n\n\nRegulatory News\n\nRegulation\nLegal\nCybercrime\n\n\n\nIndustry News\n\nExchanges\nMining\nData Service\n\n\n\nTechnology News\n\nEnterprise\nBlockchain Application\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nWrite For Us\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy\nTerms & Conditions\nAdvertise\nBlockchain Ecosystem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonetary & Financial Freedom\n\r\n                                With blockchain, we will put an end to the monopoly of government-issued currencies, as suggested in the title of Hayek\u2019s work \u2013 \u201cDenationalization of Money.\u201d Blockchain will simplify the set of concepts revolving around financial services and the complexity of the IT systems.
