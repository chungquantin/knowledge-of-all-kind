Interestingly, for the first time, the survey had an outlook on cryptocurrencies.\nAfter surveying nearly 328 top executives from insurance firms, 6% of the respondents said that they are already invested in crypto or looking to seek exposure. These respondents collectively handle almost half the $26 trillion global insurance industry.\nInterestingly, most of the insurers showing interest in crypto are from America. \u201cThe vast majority of insurers are not considering investing in cryptocurrencies,\u201d according to the report. \u201cAmerican insurers are slightly more interested\u201d.

Several industry experts had a recent conversation with CNBC media where they tried to explain the outlook of the crypto market.\n\nMost market experts agree that many of the currently existing 19,000 cryptocurrencies and dozens of blockchain platforms will disappear in the coming years.\nWhile Scott Minerd, Guggenheim\u2019s Chief Investment Officer, admitted that most cryptocurrencies are junk, he suggested Bitcoin and Ethereum would survive.\nBrad Garlinghouse, CEO of cross-border blockchain payments company Ripple, mentioned that there would likely be mere \u201cscores\u201d of cryptos that remain in the future. \u201cI think there\u2019s a question about whether or not we need 19,000 new currencies today. In the fiat world, there are maybe 180 currencies,\u201d the executive said.\nBertrand Perez, CEO of the Web3 Foundation, pointed out that the recent fall in the prices indicated a huge drawback to the market. The collapse of \u201cstablecoin\u201d called TerraUSD and associated digital token Luna, rejuvenated discussion of whether thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence will all survive.\n\u201cOne of the effects of what we\u2019ve seen last week with the Terra issue is we\u2019re at the stage where basically there are far too many blockchains out there, too many tokens. And that\u2019s confusing users. And that\u2019s also bringing some risks for the users,\u201d Perez said. \nPerez further compared the crypto market to the early dot-com days, indicating that many cryptocurrencies will not survive during bear markets. The dot-com bubble was a rapid increase in U.S. technology stock equity valuations fueled by investments in Internet-based firms in the late 1990s. The value of equity markets grew tremendously during the dot-com bubble between 1995 and 2000. However, equities entered a bear market after the bubble burst in 2001. The bubble caused several internet firms (like Cisco, Intel, Oracle, and many others) to go bust.\n\u201cLike at the beginning of the internet, you were having lots of dot-com companies and lots of them were scams, and were not bringing any value and all that got cleared. And now we have very useful and legit companies,\u201d Perez explained. \nMajor Trends \nCryptocurrency has experienced rapid growth in the last two years, but its future in 2022 and beyond is unclear. \nThe year of \u20182021\u2019 was a breakthrough for the industry as tremendous focus and attention was being paid to the sector. \nThe industry is in its infancy and constantly evolving. That is the reason why Bitcoin climbs very high and is easily followed by huge drops.\nGenerally, market analysts explain that one of the major reasons behind the dropping prices could be a low-risk appetite among traders and investors amid the global crypto crackdown.\nTechnical analysis shows the viability of the crypto market and explains institutional investors are eyeing crypto as a potential platform. Greater acceptance of Bitcoin for institutional investors has led to cryptocurrencies becoming already an acceptable form of payment in various areas. \nBanks (such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and\u00a0Goldman Sachs), some eCommerce online gaming platforms, and luxury brands (like Gucci) now accept Bitcoin. Firms like PayPal and Square and PayPal accept Bitcoin payments on their platforms. Tesla has billions worth of cryptocurrencies, and the interest of others keeps increasing. Modern customers are showing increasing interest in cryptocurrencies. \nDespite the great interest, one major challenge is the lack of security concerning cryptos. n August last year, the blockchain-based Poly Network platform lost more than $600 million to hackers.\nThe lack of adequate crypto security continues to plague the industry. Market players are trying to innovate and stabilize to fix this problem. \nRegulation is also another thing that the industry needs. It will create confidence among investors and put a greater demand on the market players to ensure that proper systems are in place.Image source: Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopied\n JPMorgan Backs Bitcoin to Rise 28%, Saying Cryptos are Preferred Alternative Asset  \n\n\nCRYPTO TOKEN MARKET ANALYSIS LUNA DOTCOM \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\nSubscribe now and get exclusive news, interviews and stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry Expert \n\n\n\nExperts Suggest Merely Tokens Might Survive after LUNA's Collapse\n\nJun 06, 2022\n| 3 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry \n\n\n\nTrade Finance Platform We.Trade on the Brink of Liquidation, Report says\n\nJun 06, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCBDC:Americas \n\n\n\nBrazil Considers CBDC Project as a Means to Innovate Digitally: Economist\n\nJun 06, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch \n\n\n\nBitcoin ATM Installations Plunge in May, CoinRadar Data Shows\n\nJun 06, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto News\n\nBitcoin News\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nEthereum News\nCardano News\nRipple News\nStablecoin News\nCBDC News\nDeFi News\nNFT News\n\n\n\nRegulatory News\n\nRegulation\nLegal\nCybercrime\n\n\n\nIndustry News\n\nExchanges\nMining\nData Service\n\n\n\nTechnology News\n\nEnterprise\nBlockchain Application\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nWrite For Us\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy\nTerms & Conditions\nAdvertise\nBlockchain Ecosystem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonetary & Financial Freedom\n\r\n                                With blockchain, we will put an end to the monopoly of government-issued currencies, as suggested in the title of Hayek\u2019s work \u2013 \u201cDenationalization of Money.\u201d Blockchain will simplify the set of concepts revolving around financial services and the complexity of the IT systems.

However, BTC has managed to register the first weekly green chandle in nearly three months.\nAs of press time, Bitcoin is trading 4% up at a price of $30,990 with a market cap of $589 billion. On a weekly chart, Bitcoin is up 2.32%. However, this could mean a sigh of relief for Bitcoin investors in the short term, it doesn\u2019t quite suggest a trend reversal here. Some analysts suggest that this could just be a bear market rally and we could be in for some more correction down the road.\nIf we see the technical chart, Bitcoin is still trading way above its 200-day moving average (DMA). Historically, BTC has bottomed around at 200 DMA or just below which is 25% down from the current levels.

And looking at the price performance of the token, one can presume that this streak may not end very soon.\nDogecoin\u2019s next chapter\u2026\n\u2026is not looking good. Primarily looking at the price indicators, DOGE is actually set for declining further on the charts, and this time, it isn\u2019t faring much support from the community either.\nThe Bollinger Bands confirm the first sign of the same given the altcoin\u2019s close movement below the basis, which provides hints of bearish influence on the coin. \nHowever, DOGE might not observe a steep fall-off given the closeness of the bands, which exhibits low volatility, i.e., low chances of a price swing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecondly, the uptrend support it had from the Parabolic SAR is waning, and the indicator is on the verge of flipping into an active downtrend. \nBut there is some recoil from the Squeeze Momentum indicator, according to which this is the first appearance of bullishness in more than 45 days.\n Dogecoin price action  | Source: TradingView \u2013 AMBCrypto\nHowever, in the past, too, this indicator hasn\u2019t been fairly accurate in its prediction of an uptrend, as the green bars usually appear at the beginning of downfall and disappear into the bearishness.\nPlus, given the state of the broader market\u2019s fear, which has been peaking for almost a month now, it doesn\u2019t seem like the minute bullishness is going to do much for the coin.\nCrypto fear and greed index | Source: Alternative\nAs it is even before Dogecoin has begun falling, investors are trying to load off by selling their holdings before the worse comes to pass.\nAs per on-chain data, at the moment, there is a much higher sell offer active in the market than there are for buying, exceeding by a margin of more than 25 million ($2 million).\n Dogecoin market selling | Source: Intotheblock \u2013 AMBCrypto\nAnd in their defense, the move makes sense since the asset\u2019s value has not only declined but is actually at its lowest point in forever. \nNaturally, investors find no reason to hold on to Dogecoin, which is reflected in their behavior. If prices fall further, which may be the most natural outcome, investors would certainly be inclined to sell more.\n Dogecoin market value  | Source: Santiment \u2013 AMBCrypto\n\n\n\n\nRead the best crypto stories of the day in less than 5 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get it daily in your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select your Email Preferences.\n\n\nThe Daily Digest\n\n\nThe Weekly Digest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRelated Topics:DOGEDOGE price falldogecoinDogecoin holdersDogecoin investorsDogecoin price fallMemecoin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss\nPutting the \u2018stable\u2019 in stablecoins: How Djed & USDD are trying to make it big\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAaryamann Shrivastava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAaryamann is a freelance crypto journalist working with AMBCrypto.

According to Be[In]Crypto research, Solana had a total sales volume of around $2.35 billion, as of June 5.\u00a0\nThis comes as a boost to the project after its native asset, SOL, tumbled by more than $14 billion in market capitalization in May.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe milestone puts Solana in third place behind Ronin and Ethereum.\u00a0\nWith that said, Solana commands a higher all-time sales volume than Flow, Polygon, WAX, Avalanche, Palm, Tezos, Waves, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and Panini.\u00a0\nSource: All-Time Blockchain NFT Sales Volume Rankings by CryptoSlam\nWhat caused soaring Solana sales volume?\u00a0\nWhen looking at the increasing number of unique buyers from October 2021, the surge in sales led to the blockchain\u2019s ascending total transaction counts totaling 83,697 unique buyers and 374,618 transactions. By the end of October, Solana\u2019s sales volume was in the region of $286.4 million.\u00a0\nAn 83% spike in the number of unique buyers from October led to a new all-time high in the number of new buyers of NFT on Solana in January 2022. In January 2022, unique buyers were 153,602 which corresponded to 1,014,963 transactions. Coincidentally, this month also proved to be Solana\u2019s all-time high in monthly sales volume with around $298.69 million.\nSource: Solana January 2022 Sales Volume Chart by CryptoSlam\nPopular NFTs on Solana that contributed to this volume include but are not limited to Chainers, Thug Birdz, Meerkat Millionaire Country Club, Frakt, Portals, Solsteads, Cosmic Condos, SolPunks, Blockstars, Akuma no Neko, Infinity Labs, and Solarians.\u00a0\nOther months that made noteworthy contributions to Solana sales were September 2021 ($263.34 million), February 2022 ($206.3 million), April 2022 ($294.8 million), and May 2022 ($256.1 million).\u00a0\nSOL price reaction\u00a0\nSOL opened on Jan. 1, 2022, with a trading price of $170.31, reached a yearly high of $179.43 on Jan. 2, and tested a new local low of $38.36 on June 2. SOL was trading at $40 at the time of press. \nOverall, this equates to a 77% decrease in the price of SOL throughout 2022.\u00a0\nSource: SOL/USD Chart by TradingViewDisclaimer\nAll the information contained on our website is published in good faith and for general information purposes only.

Founded in 2017, We.Trade has garnered interest from the likes of IBM which joined the firm back in 2020 as it was expanding its blockchain strategy at the time.\nThere are as many as 12 banks that are part of the We.Trade joint venture, including HSBC, became the first banking institution to finance a trade using the Hyperledger Fabric. The inaugural interests from We.Trade stirred the startup to secure as much as 5.5 million Euros back in 2021, and the failure to secure additional funding has led to the complications stirring a liquidation at this time.\nThe We.Trade disintegration will not be the first of its kind in the blockchain world as Meta Platform Inc\u2019s Diem Project was also unable to see the light of day due to excessive regulatory pressures with respect to its stablecoin creation plans. Earlier this year, the Diem project, which started out as Libra but later rebranded, announced its asset sale as it made a move to close shop and sell off its intellectual properties.\nSilvergate Bank acquired the IP as Meta Platforms also sought avenues to pay off investors who had injected resources into the project from inception to that point.

The reasons primarily involve providing \u201centrepreneurs with a safe and reliable environment to innovate through the use of programmability technologies, such as programable money and smart contracts.\u201d\nFabio maintained the fact that the payment landscape in Brazil is already very advanced and the embrace of very fast digital payment models has been in the works for more than 20 years. While Fabio does not believe the payment landscape needs any revolutionary revamping, he believes the CBDC must add more value beyond efficient payments.\n\u201cIn the context of a modern payment system, already available to the Brazilian population, a full-fledged CBDC must enable new functionalities beyond those brought by an instant payment arrangement. Therefore, the innovation tool for which the BCB envisions the greatest potential is developing a platform for smart payments,\u201d he wrote in a recent publication from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\nEmbracing Crypto-Backed Innovations\u00a0\nIn the paper, Fabio said cryptocurrencies are already a reality. He highlighted that the technologies are so novel that they can benefit a large number of citizens if given the appropriate regulatory oversight.\n\u201cAsset tokenisation and the issuance of digital assets is a reality.

Already surrounded by hawkish Fed policies, the massive crash led to severe losses and some lost interest.\nHowever, despite taking into consideration the current state of the market, TRON and Cardano are looking to add new stablecoins, which has raised concerns across the community.\nWe\u2019re not the same as Terra!\nThe Cardano team announced the mainnet launch of Djed, a decentralized and algorithmic stablecoin built on Cardano. Djed uses Shen as a reserve token to ensure price stability in volatile economic conditions. It uses smart contracts to ensure price stabilization, and will be further useful for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) operations. As per the launch post on Medium.com, Djed is designed to become the ultimate coin with which Cardano\u2019s network transaction fees will be paid.\nFollowing the testnet, some key issues were identified which include\u00a0\u201cunavailable request\u201d and \u201cinvalid collateral type\u201d. COTI outlined that identifying such issues is normal and assured users that these issues will be sorted out prior to the release of the coin\u2019s\u00a0mainnet\u00a0launch in June, as per the Cardano Feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDjed\u2019s imminent mainnet launch is in a long line of Cardano\u2019s recent developments. The Vasil hard fork is also set for launch towards the end of June with high expectations from the community.\nTRON, the mighty!\nTRON is another blockchain that is looking to initiate the launch of mainnet version of USDD. However, the path seems far more complicated for them due to the underlying similarities with the Terra stablecoin. There is still a lot of outrage since the Terra crash because of how the the LFG handled the situation. Hence, there has been a vocal dissent against the USDD launch as well.\nIn a news release, TRON described the collateral ratio as \u201cguaranteed\u201d. It has an even higher collateral ratio than DAI\u2019s 120%, standing at at least 130%. The real-time collateral ratio of USDD is published on the TRON DAO Reserve\u2019s website, publicly available 24/7.\nSimilar to Terra, TRON has invested billions in risk assets such as Bitcoin and other crypto to support USDD in times of volatility. This particular comparison has enraged the crypto sphere because Terra also had a huge Bitcoin reserve.\nBut TRON Founder Justin Sun believes the diversified reserves can actually help safeguard USDD.\nHe said, \u201cThe reserve backing we\u2019re using right now is highly diversified. It includes bitcoin and all different kinds of stablecoin. USDC will be a part of our reserve, but it will only be a small part of our reserve.\u201d\nAccording to a TRON spokesperson, the reserve contains 14,040 bitcoin (around $418 million), 140 million USDT, and 1.9 billion TRX, as well as 8.29 billion TRX in a burning contract.\nIn retrospect, the ongoing bear market does pose a tricky future for these blockchains as investors and traders are still trying to recover from the havoc caused by the Terra debacle.\n\n\n\n\nRead the best crypto stories of the day in less than 5 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get it daily in your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select your Email Preferences.\n\n\nThe Daily Digest\n\n\nThe Weekly Digest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRelated Topics:CardanoDjedTerraTronUSDD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss\nSolana: Mapping out profitable entry and exit triggers for SOL traders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKanav Jain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKanav is a journalist at AMBCrypto.

In its south-looking trajectory, SOL poked the $35-zone for the first time in over nine months.\nAs the alt continues its squeeze between the falling wedge, the next few candles would be critical to determine a breakout rally.\nA close beyond the pattern would open up short-term buying opportunities, provided the bulls ramp up the buying volumes. At press time, SOL traded at $39.27, up by 6.23% in the last 24 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOL Daily Chart\nSource: TradingView, SOL/USD\nSOL\u2019s devaluation from the $85-mark made way for a bear run that accounted for a 62.5% weekly decline (5-12 May). Consequently, it pulled to touch its nine-month low on 12 May.\nAs the selling pressure heightened, the alt has been depreciating between the bounds of a falling wedge while approaching its ten-month support at the $38-mark.\nA potential bounce-back alongside the reversal pattern could give the bulls a much-needed hope to break above the wedge. More often than not, a falling wedge setup a followed by an up breakout.\nHowever, the declining volume trend could play out in favor of the bears in the coming sessions. Also, the basis line (green) of the Bollinger Bands (BB) still looked south and affirmed the bearish edge.\nA close beyond the wedge would expose the alt to test the basis line of the BB. The bulls have not found a close above the basis line in nearly two months. Any close beyond this line could serve as an entry trigger with a take-profit level in the $50-$52 range.\u00a0\nShould the buyers dwindle, any pullbacks could provoke a down breakout toward the $32-$34 range before a likely bullish comeback.\nRationale\nSource: TradingView, SOL/USD\nAs per the RSI\u2019s oversold outlook, a revival could be due for SOL if the buyers hold on to their immediate grounds. The index, at press time, was on a slight uptrend after bullishly diverging with price in the last week.\nSimilarly, the higher troughs on the CMF revealed a bullish divergence with price over the last week. But the Aroon up (yellow) was lurking near the 7%-level. Until the Aroon up sees a robust northbound recovery, the investors/traders could avoid placing calls.\nConclusion\nSOL\u2019s reversal pattern alongside the bullish divergences on its indicators can ease the selling pressure in the coming sessions. Investors/traders should wait for a close above the Basis line of BB and improvements on the Aroon indicator to place calls.\nIn case of a bullish invalidation, bears could find rebounding grounds in the $32-$34 range. Finally, keeping an eye on Bitcoin\u2019s movement would be vital in making informed calls.\n\n\n\n\nRead the best crypto stories of the day in less than 5 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get it daily in your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select your Email Preferences.\n\n\nThe Daily Digest\n\n\nThe Weekly Digest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRelated Topics:SOL price prediction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss\nSTEPN: Amid reports of spam accounts and DDOS attacks, how are its tokens reacting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYash Majithia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a background in financial analysis and reporting, Yash is a full-time journalist at AMBCrypto.

One of the first cross-chain NFT search engines, Search 3 lets consumers search NFTs directly from their wallets or contracts with entities across Ethereum, BLOCKS, Polygon, Solana, and Gnosis.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWe are really excited to introduce this sort of core magnet that is search 3, meaning this is your front door to Web3, and around that, we have the Humbl wallet bringing in digital wallets, NFTs, verifiable credentials, and things that allow you to step up to the counter and transact in value between you and another person, you and a corporation or you and a government,\u201d Foote explained in the Youtube video.\u00a0SourceConsumers can further verify that NFTs have been \"Verified by BLOCKS,\" preventing fraud and forgery on NFT marketplaces. Additionally, the search engine displays the various marketplaces from which NFTs can be purchased.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThis will be one of the first search engines in the world where you can look for NFTs by name, wallet address, and contract address across Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana. Like if you type in BAYC, it comes back with a price, description details, and other functionalities,\u201d the CEO further added.Also on the way is the HUMBL Web Wallet, which lets users swap, transact with, and manage digital assets using Web 3. While transacting on the Search 3 ecosystem, the Web Wallet employs security features such as two-factor authentication and enhanced warnings on potentially questionable transactions.HUMBL plans on monetizing the Web 3 search engine through advertising sales, branded content, NFTs, marketplace commissions, tokenized incentive and loyalty programs, as well as referral fees on delivery services.As part of the Search 3 roadmap, customers can use other Web 3 services in the coming days, including Metaverse, Government Services, and Origin Assurance, to track merchandise and collectibles using blockchain. Further, HUMBL is also developing a companion \u201cMail 3\u201d privacy-focused email service for global customers.\u00a0BSC News reached out to Brian Foote for more information on Search3, but we didn\u2019t get a response. You can access the Search 3 engine here.\u200dWhat is Humbl Pay:With Humbl's Merchant Services Software, governments can migrate national currencies to digital versions and perform critical functions like cross-border remittance, foreign exchange, bill payment, and lending from smartphones.

Sustainability as the number of users continues to climb is a major problem faced by blockchain games with a play-to-earn business model.\u00a0\nOn STEPN, it was observed that some players use bots and GPS spoofing to inflate the number of tokens generated by using the application.\nIn the Twitter post, STEPN noted that following the system upgrade that led to hours of downtime on the platform, some runners were identified as bots via the new system. This was a result of 25 million DDOS attacks sent to the server within a short period of time. This caused some users to be kicked off the platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssuring its users that all was back to normal, STEPN confirmed that the network had been restored and \u201cdata transfers have reopened and remain stable.\u201d It also stated that users need not be worried about being tagged as bot again.\nIn light of these events, how did STEPN\u2019s GMT and GST-SOL tokens react?\nRunners continue to look away\nIn the last 24 hours, both STEPN tokens have recorded declines. Exchanging hands at a price of $0.9537 per GMT token, the token suffered a 6% decline in the last 24 hours. With a 20.56% drop in trading volume in the last 24 hours, increased distribution appeared to be underway at press time.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nAlso on a downtrend was STEPN\u2019s GST-SOL token which recorded a 19.18% loss\u00a0 in the last 24 hours. However, a Down Volume was spotted. At press time, volume was up by 11.53% while press was down. This generally represents a shift towards a correction or bear market.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nAs for movements on the price charts, increased selling pressure was spotted. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) pegging its position at 35 in a downward curve and the 50 EMA trend line spotted above price at press time, the bears were having a field day. \nSource: TradingView\nAlso struggling to ward off the bears, the RSI for the GST-SOL token was spotted below the 50 neutral region at the 26 index.\nSource: TradingView\nWhen all the chips fall down\u00a0\nOn-chain data showed that the GMT token has suffered quite a bit on a social front for a while now. At the time of writing, social dominance was seen at 0.943%, accruing over 70% decline in about five days. Within the same time, the social volume has also gone down by 92%.\nSource: Santiment\nThe GST-SOL on the other hand recorded gains in its social dominance. In the last four days, this value has grown by 261%. The social volume however suffered a 97% decline in the last five days. \nSource: Santiment\n\n\n\n\nRead the best crypto stories of the day in less than 5 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get it daily in your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select your Email Preferences.\n\n\nThe Daily Digest\n\n\nThe Weekly Digest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRelated Topics:GMTGMT price predictionGSTSTEPN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss\nAAVE ushers in bearish correction after mid-May rally but is it ready for an upside\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAbiodun Oladokun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbiodun is a full-time journalist working with AMBCrypto.
