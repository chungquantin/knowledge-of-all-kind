ADA has widely outperformed its contemporaries in the last week due to a mix of bullish fundamental and technical factors.\nADA Making Waves\nCryptocurrencies were largely in the green Monday, giving investors hopes of a much-needed recovery after the nauseating correction in May. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap reclaimed the $31,400 level, more than a 5.74% gain on the day. Ethereum (ETH) went up 5.79% over the same timeframe.\nCardano\u2019s ADA meanwhile is leading gains among the top ten largest cryptocurrencies. ADA soared as much as 12.04% on the last day to trade at $0.6224. The crypto asset is now the sixth most-valued cryptocurrency with a market cap of $21 billion.\nThere has also been a dramatic increase in ADA\u2019s trading volume across leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Its trading volume stands at around $1.2 billion in the last 24 hours, 162.56% up from the previous day.\nWhat\u2019s Fueling Cardano\u2019s Pump?\nThe primary fundamental catalysts behind today\u2019s bullish price action are the increased DeFi activity and the upcoming Vasil hard fork.\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\nCardano implemented the Alonzo fork in August 2021, ushering in smart contract functionality. ADA gained over 100% in the span of a month after the coin entered the decentralized application space with Alonzo. Approximately 93 decentralized applications have now been built atop Cardano since this hard fork, and many of these apps are registering heightened activity.\nThe Layer 1 proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain also recently revealed its Djed stablecoin and released an array of Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) that aim to make transactions faster and cheaper. Furthermore, there has been a spike in the issuance of native assets on Cardano \u2014 data shows more than five million assets have now been minted on the blockchain.\nAdditionally, Cardano has gained the attention of institutional investors who are even converting their bitcoin and ethereum assets into ADA because they believe in its high potential in the future. This increased interest in ADA by whales has played a role in the coin\u2019s recent uptrend.\nDespite today\u2019s bullish action, ADA is still trading almost 80% below its September 2021 peak of $3.09.\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\u00a0 \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\u00a0 \r\n\u00a0 \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Ads by Cointraffic\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \r\n\u00a0 \n \n\n \n\n TAGSADAUSDCardanoCryptocurrency News \nPrevious articleBored Apes Creator Trolls Discord After 200 ETH Worth Of NFTs Stolen In Another Hack Brenda NgariBrenda is a crypto and Blockchain enthusiast and has been crafting articles for at least a year.

At press time, BTC surged by more than 6% as it traded at the $31.5k mark. But that doesn\u2019t fade the fact BTC remains down by 32.5% since the start of the year. Also, HODLers have suffered immense losses. Thus, considering this scenario, can BTC continue the uptrend?\nBurning the midnight oil\nBTC witnessed the first-ever positive close over the last ten weeks. Following this, on-chain data provider Santiment highlighted that the total BTC whale holdings reached a one-month high.\nSource: Santiment\nBTC\u2019s mega whales now own the largest percentage of the asset\u2019s supply in over one year as evident in the graph above. \n\u201cThe mega whale addresses of Bitcoin, comprised partially of exchange addresses, own their highest supply of BTC in a year. We often analyze the 100 to 10k $BTC addresses for alpha, but accumulation from this high tier can still be a promising sign.\u201d\nThe largest crypto showcased similar signs that could help BTC continue the trend. For instance, one of the more positive trends is that the number of daily active addresses is on a steady rise as visible in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Glassnode\nIn addition to this, here\u2019s another interesting narrative. The capitulation of long-term holders throughout this bear market has begun. But here\u2019s the question. Given BTC\u2019s past, long term holders at press time are selling their shares at a huge loss yet this may resemble a positive scenario for the king coin.\nMarkets usually tend to put in a bottom, when massive losses are inflicted on the market participants, an event which is known as \u201ccapitulation\u201d. In bear markets, long-term holders\u2019 capitulation usually marks a multi-year bottom. This may not be a one-off event, and it could take weeks or months for long-term holders to capitulate definitively.\nHere\u2019s the Spent Output Profit Ratio stats:\nSource: CryptoQuant\nConsidering the graph, the blog post added:\n\u201cThe long-term holders\u2019 SOPR is a metric which measures the amount of profits/losses which are realized by this (LTH) cohort. It is evident that during previous bear markets, a lengthy period of long-term holders\u2019 capitulation occured as these participants exited the market at a loss and selling their unervalued coins to new participants or smart money.\nThey are happy to buy an undervalued asset in huge chunks and hold for extraordinary returns in the future bull market.\u201d\nOverall this could play a bullish development for BTC.\nIs there a catch here?\u00a0\nAlthough BTC showed some incline, considering the past performance of the king token, this incline could fade away. On 1 May, the largest cryptocurrency spiked to $32,375, which was the highest level in three weeks. But it ended up erasing its gains the following day and then came perilously close to scoring yet another week in the red.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nRead the best crypto stories of the day in less than 5 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get it daily in your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select your Email Preferences.\n\n\nThe Daily Digest\n\n\nThe Weekly Digest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRelated Topics:BitcoinBitcoin long term holdersBTCGlassnode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss\nPolkadot: This breakdown pattern in DOT can spell bad news for the near term\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nShubham Pandey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShubham is a full-time journalist at AMBCrypto.

The regulatory body wrote:\u00a0\"As with other virtual assets, NFTs are exposed to heightened risks, including illiquid secondary markets, volatility, opaque pricing, hacking and fraud. Investors should be mindful of these risks, and if they cannot fully understand them and bear the potential losses, they should not invest in NFTs.\"However, it appears that the SFC's specific concern lies in the securitization of NFTs. \"The majority of NFTs observed by the SFC are intended to represent a unique copy of an underlying asset such as a digital image, artwork, music or video,\" which do not require regulation by the SFC.But assets that push the boundary between collectibles and financial assets, such as fractionalized or fungible NFTs structured as securities or collective investment schemes (CIS) in NFTs, do fall under the SFC's mandate. The solicitation of Hong Kong residents by companies engaged in these activities require the issuer to obtain a license from the SFC unless an exemption applies.CIS has recently gained traction as they present a plausible solution for individual investors to obtain fractional ownership of real-life collectibles that would be otherwise too cost-prohibitive for any single party. Yet, questions persist as to whether such investment structures constitute securitization. One recent effort launched by the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp (KMSKA) to tokenize a million-euro classic painting on the blockchain was conducted via debt securitization. The venture met regulatory requirements via the aid of blockchain entities Rubey and Tokeny. #Blockchain  #Cryptocurrencies  #Hong Kong  #Investments  #Regulation  #NFT  Related News  Blockchain Can Disrupt Higher Education Today, Global Labor Market Tomorrow  Fully managed end-to-end marketplace releases NFTs with high holder rewards  Crypto 401(k): Sound financial planning or gambling with the future?

While the early 2010s saw startups founded by small groups of crypto enthusiasts, the space has since grown to become home to large institutional businesses.Still, crypto companies are engaged in business, and business is alien to anarchy. The rapid growth of the cryptocurrency industry in the 2010s transformed small, independent businesses into huge conglomerates with thousands of employees and offices worldwide. Investment funds and professional investors own shares of them, many have functioning boards of directors, and their corporate structures have dozens of departments and divisions. But does all this bureaucracy destroy the very philosophy of cryptocurrency?Like any other company, most cryptocurrency businesses got their start when their founders came up with the idea to launch a business. The difference, however, is that crypto is not only a new form of finance but also has an ideological foundation that combines the spirit of decentralization, freedom and anonymity. Over the last decade, cryptocurrencies have challenged traditional fiat currencies and rejected many of the rules of the financial world, causing confusion in the measured life of the global investment industry.From the very beginningThe cryptocurrency exchange Huobi was founded by two co-founders, Du Jun and Leon Li, in September 2013. By November 2013, Huobi had already reached a Bitcoin (BTC) transaction volume of 1 billion yuan (around $6 billion at the time) and began receiving funding from prominent investors. In its first year of existence, Huobi\u2019s headcount grew to exceed 100 people, and the exchange now counts more than 2,000 employees in its corporate structure. It has rapidly transformed from a cryptocurrency startup to a large company with a multibillion-dollar turnover. Institutional investors such as Chinese venture fund Zhen Fund and Sequoia Capital bought stakes in Huobi back in 2013 and 2014, respectively.1inch Network, another exchange, was founded at the ETHNewYork hackathon in May 2019 by Sergej Kunz and Anton Bukov, engineers with many years of software development experience. Today, 1inch is a decentralized network of over 100 contributors distributed all over the world. From what can be gathered, the company does not have an office, and employees can work from anywhere in the world. Nevertheless, it has a corporate structure, as well as funding from Binance Labs that it received in August 2020.Corporate colorsIn 2014, Frederic Laloux\u2019s book Reinventing Organizations was published. It was the result of a three-year study of 12 companies (including Patagonia, Zappos and Sounds True) that promoted unconventional management practices and principles. In the book, Laloux identifies five types of companies, which he categorizes according to their form of corporate governance: red, orange, yellow, green and teal. According to the author, teal companies represent the highest form of organization. They are characterized by the absence of a hierarchical structure, maximum transparency and employees\u2019 great freedom to make decisions and express their opinions.Recent:\u00a0A life after crime: What happens to crypto seized in criminal investigations?Unfortunately, Laloux did not study financial organizations, much less financial startups, so there is no information in his book about which color cryptocurrency companies could be classified as. Nevertheless, an executive at Huobi and a founder of 1inch told Cointelegraph that they consider their companies to be teal.Describing Laloux\u2019s theory of the evolution of organizations, Jeff Mei, director of global strategy at Huobi Global, told Cointelegraph that teal represents the final stage, characterized by \u201ccomplex adaptive systems with distributed authority, often structured as decentralized, self-managed teams or networks.\u201d In this stage, \u201cstatic pyramidal hierarchies give way to fluid natural hierarchies, where power shifts to the people with the most experience, passion or interest.\u201dSource: ReadingraphicsMei said that this description \u201ccoincides with Huobi\u2019s core beliefs as well as the underlying values of blockchain itself.\u201d1inch co-founder Bukov told Cointelegraph he believes that his company\u2019s efforts \u201cto create a \u2018teal organization\u2019 are not only successful but also quite sustainable in the long term. While a corporate hierarchy may work for some companies, it is not very suitable for decentralized finance projects. In fact, the less hierarchical the project structure, the better.\u201d He added:\u201cBut consistency between different teams is vital to make sure they are on the same page. Adherence to rules is absolutely normal for DeFi projects, and freedom should by no means mean breaking laws. Freedom and decentralization remain core values of 1inch Network, no matter the size of the project. Our teams enjoy a high degree of independence, and if, for example, a team doesn\u2019t think an idea is promising and worth pursuing, it will be debated until a consensus is reached.\u201dFreedom or compliance?The ideology of blockchain and cryptocurrencies \u2014 expressed in decentralization, freedom and anonymity \u2014 has recently been tested and even questioned by some cryptocurrency companies.\u00a0Mei said that \u201cThanks to numerous regulations by governments around the world, as well as security breaches and even coin crashes, we have concluded in 2022 that cryptocurrency as an asset needs some form of regulation to serve as an anchor and bottom line for protection.\u201dHe added that \u201cA degree of compliance and regulation is necessary for cryptocurrency as an asset class to become generally accepted, but the nature of blockchain technology should always allow for a degree of autonomy and decentralization. These two contrasting ideologies must coexist to some degree.\u201dRecent:\u00a0Crypto 401(k): Sound financial planning or gambling with the future?According to Mei, exchanges like Huobi operate on a spectrum where decentralization and compliance already coexist: \u201cTransparency and accountability must remain in certain aspects of traditional corporate structures, but we can learn from the spirit of pooled contribution and collaboration. A system with a more secure, efficient distribution of work and information is beneficial in both the blockchain world and the corporate structure.\u201dTeal or red futureThe cryptocurrency industry has developed rapidly in recent years, and this will only continue. Many companies operating in the cryptocurrency market declare a commitment to the values characteristic of \u201cteal\u201d organizations. Of course, as cryptocurrency companies proliferate and become institutionalized investment businesses, corporate governance practices will change as well. Striving for openness, self-governance and consensus may face tough regulatory requirements, competitive pressures and other external challenges.Will cryptocurrency companies be able to stay true to the original values of the industry, or will they be forced to become more centralized and \u201cred\u201d? Time will tell. For now, however, Huobi\u2019s and 1inch\u2019s representatives are optimistic. A curious fact: During Huobi\u2019s recent brand refresh, its official colors took on a new teal and green hue. One can only hope that moving forward, the company will be able to keep these colors as an element of their governance, not only their logo. #Blockchain  #Business  #Decentralization  #Technology  #Transactions  #Fintech  #Adoption  Related News  ETH Miners Will Have Little Choice Once Ethereum 2.0 Launches With PoS  Fully managed end-to-end marketplace releases NFTs with high holder rewards  Purrfect match: The story of a young girl\u2019s love of cats and NFTs  Crypto 401(k): Sound financial planning or gambling with the future?

The exchange calls it a \"woefully misinformed op-ed.\"\nBy Stacy ElliottJun 6, 2022Jun 6, 20224 min readBinance is one of the world's biggest crypto exchanges. Image: ShutterstockCreate an account to save your articles.A new report from Reuters estimates that at least $2.35 billion in illicit funds have been laundered through Binance between 2017 and 2021.\u00a0\nThe news agency analyzed court records, spoke with law enforcement, and worked with blockchain analysis firms Chainalysis and Crystal Blockchain to track illicit funds on the exchange.\nAs of Monday morning, Binance was the largest crypto exchange, accounting for $10.5 billion in spot and $41.4 billion in derivatives volume over the last day, according to CoinMarketCap.\u00a0\nThe report quotes Binance Chief Communications Officer Patrick Hillman, who told Reuters that he did not believe its analysis was accurate.\u00a0\nHe did tell the news agency that the company was in the process of assembling \"the most sophisticated cyber forensics team on the planet\" that would \"further improve our ability to detect illegal crypto activity on our platform.\"\nA Binance spokesperson shared a response to the article with Decrypt, saying that the company has received \"an outpouring of support from partners in law enforcement across the globe\" since the article was published on Monday morning.\n\"We're aware of Angus Berwick's latest woefully misinformed op-ed,\" the spokesperson said in an email. \"It should be noted that the article uses outdated information from 2019 and unverified personal attestations as a crutch to establish a false narrative.\"\nThe report connects several notable events and platforms, including the hack of a Slovakian crypto exchange Eterbase, darknet marketplace Hydra, and the North Korean hacking group Lazarus, each of which involved Binance to facilitate various crypto transactions.\nEterbase\nIn September 2020, attackers from the Lazarus group created anonymous Binance accounts and used them to launder a portion of $5.4 million stolen from Slovakian cryptocurrency exchange Eterbase, according to the Reuters analysis.\n\"Binance had no idea who was moving money through their exchange,\" said Eterbase co-founder Robert Auxt.\u00a0\nAfter the hack, Eterbase sought to work with Binance to recover the stolen funds. On September 9, 2020, Reuters reported that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that the exchange would \"do what we can to assist\" Eterbase.\n\nEmails shared with Reuters reportedly show that Binance declined to share information or account data without a request from law enforcement.\u00a0\nEterbase eventually shut down its exchange and eventually filed for bankruptcy.\nThe company filed a criminal complaint with Slovakia's National Crime Agency (NCA) in June 2021. After the NCA sent two requests to Binance, according to the report, the exchange sent records for 24 accounts that were linked to usernames like \"benjaminfranklin\" and \"garathbale.\"\u00a0\u00a0\nHydra\nThe Reuters report also estimates that Russian-language darknet site Hydra used Binance\u00a0to process payments for drugs totaling $780 million.\u00a0\u00a0\nHillman told Reuters that the total was \"inaccurate and overblown.\"\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Justice Department announced that it had cooperated with German law enforcement to seize Hydra's servers. At the time, the DOJ estimated that Hydra was responsible for 80% of all darknet crypto transactions and that it had received $5.2 billion since 2015.\n\nPosts reviewed by Reuters from Hydra show that in March 2018, Binance was the preferred way to process payments because of the minimal identifying information required to create an account.\n\"This is the fastest and cheapest way I've tried,\" one user wrote, according to Reuters.\n\nLazarus Attacks\nThe report frequently mentions Lazarus, a group of hackers that U.S. law enforcement has said uses its ill-gotten gains to fund North Korea's nuclear weapons program. As a result, the U.S. sanctioned Lazarus in 2019.\u00a0\nChainalysis, which worked with Reuters on the report, estimates that the group had stolen crypto worth $1.75 billion by 2020.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Lazarus used Binance to launder money from the $5.4 million Eterbase attack in 2020 too, and the $622 million attack on the Ronin sidechain that connects Axie Infinity to the Ethereum network.\nHilman told Reuters that Binance has identified and frozen more than $5 million connected to the Ronin sidechain hack. He also said that the exchange continues to work with law enforcement agencies in the investigation.\nCopy article linkWant to be a crypto expert?

Today\u2019s launch follows successful testnet launches in March.\nLiquid staking enables investors to earn yield on tokens when they are being staked on a proof-of-stake blockchain network. It provides an additional liquidity avenue for staked tokens that are typically subject to lock-up periods.\nHarbour clients will receive Harbour tokens in exchange for their staked ETH on the platform.

The NY mining ban does none of that. It\u2019s a moral victory for a few, detached from reality.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHowever, he doesn\u2019t lose hope, saying that \u201cNY had (& still has) a chance to lead the way on crypto broadly & Bitcoin mining specifically,\u201d explaining that incentives are more productive than bans:\n\u201cGood policy here would mean both carrots & sticks: at minimum, an incentive for miners to shift toward renewables is an easy win.\u201d\nHe also called upon Governor Kathy Hochul to veto the bill \u201cfor the sake of New York\u201d and \u201cat a time when keeping crypto in the US is a matter of national importance.\u201d\nFinally, Chervinsky urges the state of California to learn from New York\u2019s mistakes if it wishes to remain the technology capital of the world and the home of Web3 \u2013 at a time when it \u201cis starting to analyze these issues under the process established by Gavin Newsom\u2019s executive order.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest News\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency news \n\nEnglish Premier League ventures into NFTs and the metaverse with trademark filings \n\n60 mins ago \u00b7 3 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency news \n\nBlockchain Association argues New York mining ban won\u2019t \u2018reduce carbon emissions\u2019 \n\n2 hours ago \u00b7 3 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency news \n\nBinance used to launder over $2.3 billion in illicit funds, investigation shows \n\n2 hours ago \u00b7 3 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency news \n\nAll you need to know about the upcoming DOGE update 1.46.6 \n\n4 hours ago \u00b7 2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency news \n\nEthiopia\u2019s central bank says it\u2019s illegal for businesses to accept Bitcoin \n\n4 hours ago \u00b7 2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStocks news \n\nSun Power and First Solar rally as Biden plans to waive solar tariffs \n\n5 hours ago \u00b7 3 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCryptocurrency news \n\nHere\u2019s a list of the first 14 cryptos listed on CoinMarketCap when it launched back in 2013 \n\n5 hours ago \u00b7 2 mins read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin us on\n\n Twitter\n or \n Telegram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr follow us on\nFlipboard \n\n\n\n\nLike the article?

What's more, we should not be afraid of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\u201cCBDCs are [a]natural evolution of digital dollars and digital currencies.\u201dWhile the WEF saw calls from some bankers for a CBDC rollout to slow down, Barbosa explained that a CBDC could be with us in this decade. Hyperledger\u2019s work overlaps that of CBDCs, particularly in light of a partnership with the Digital Dollar Project. The nonprofit organization seeks to further the research into a U.S. CBDC. The key to CBDC implementation, however, is in succeeding with \u201cprivacy-preserving methods.\u201dAn advocate for digital identity, privacy and \u201chaving control of your data,\u201d Barbosa also\u00a0shared the story of how she got into Bitcoin while living in San Francisco and working for Dow Jones in the mid-2010s.\u201cI did go to a [Bitcoin] meetup once and I was older than everybody else and also female\u2014and I thought, maybe this is not for me?\u201dFortunately, Barbosa kept abreast of Bitcoin and the market when time allowed before joining HyperLedger, an enterprise blockchain solutions-based company, in 2016.
