Hopefully, if you were making this purchase with bitcoin, you\u2019d put many many more eggs in your basket,\u201d it wrote.Crypto Twitter reactsThe blog post ultimately drew ire from the crypto community on Twitter, with many arguing that the fed was \u201ccherry-picking\u201d the time period to push the narrative of Bitcoin\u2019s instability, rather than \u201czooming out\u201d, which would instead show the massive devaluation of the U.S. dollar.The Fed wrote a post showing the price of eggs in USD and Bitcoin, comparing them over the last year, showing Bitcoin as more volatile and unpredictable.Only problem was they forgot to zoom outhttps://t.co/WrCyaI4NP6 pic.twitter.com/rJVbedAs2z\u2014 Nick Neuman (, ) (@Nneuman) June 6, 2022\n\nA Twitter user going by the name @MapleHodl pointed out the obvious by stating that the USD is continuously depreciating over time and Bitcoin is volatile short term, though appreciating, so \u201cstack yolks accordingly.\u201d\u00a0Other Twitter users said that for the Fed to even recognize Bitcoin as a unit of account as being a net positive sign for the king crypto.Even the Fed is starting to price consumer goods in BTC.

From 2018 to 2019, LTH losses reached a peak of 0.015% of the market cap, and those losses extended for about a year. The current losses to long-termers have only been observed for about a month.Glassnode writes that LTH losses now resemble those from previous bear markets, but that they need to continue for a longer period of time before being truly comparable. The report states:\u201cThe LTH losses on coins deposited to exchanges have now reached a magnitude comparable to previous bear markets. However, we do not yet have the duration component.\u201dGlassnode defines LTH as a holder that has not moved their coins for at least 155 days. However, anyone that bought BTC before December 2019 will still be up on their investment \u2026 for now. It is also worth noting that in both 2019 and 2020, prices rapidly recovered by bouncing off their lows. Cointelegraph reported on Tuesday that there will likely be a capitulation event before any significant price recovery can take place.Despite the gloomy price outlook, inflows to digital asset investment products such as Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) topped $100 million last week. CoinShares June 6 report highlights that most of the inflows were from the Americas, suggesting that European investors are still bearish at the moment. Related: Amid crypto bear market, institutional investors scoop up Bitcoin: CoinSharesCoinShares also pointed out the difference in exchange flows between BTC and Ethereum (ETH). BTC exchange inflows have netted about $506 million in value through 2022 so far, whereas ETH has had net outflows of $357 million. This suggests that market sentiment for ETH is much lower than that for BTC at the moment.Bitcoin prices are down 5.3% over the past 24 hours, trading at $29,567 according to data from CoinGecko. Ethereum is down 6.7% over the same period, trading at $1,756 having lost 34% over the past month.  #Bitcoin  #BTC Markets  #HODL  #Market Analysis  Related News  The Big Four Are Gearing Up to Become Crypto and Blockchain Auditors  Fully managed end-to-end marketplace releases NFTs with high holder rewards  A life after crime: What happens to crypto seized in criminal investigations?

Similar to various public chains such as Ethereum and Polkadot, Cube Chain is committed to resolving the blockchain\u2019s trilemma \u2014 a widely-held belief that decentralized networks can only provide two out of three benefits at any given time with respect to decentralization, security, and scalability.\u00a0\nThe popularity of large-scale applications of blockchain technologies such as GameFi, DeFi, and NFT, have fueled the market need for public chains that encompass high performance and advanced security while maintaining scalability. Cube Chain fully intends to fulfill all three criteria while catering to market demand, and early reception from the public contains strong success indicators. Since its testnet (blockchain used for testing and experimentation) was launched on 25 May, transaction volumes have exceeded 1.7 million, while the total number of addresses has exceeded 134,000.\u00a0\nA slew of next-generation features places Cube Chain in an ideal position to solve the blockchain trilemma while meeting the needs of the blockchain market.\nThe key architecture behind Cube Chain splits the functions of the blockchain more systematically to optimize performance, security, and scalability. Cube Chain is designed with the execution layer for transaction execution by using the ZK Rollup-based Validium solution and a self-developed Collaborative Rollup solution as the system\u2019s execution engine.\u00a0\nConsensus-wise, Cube Chain uses a settlement layer that is fully compatible with EVM and Ethereum protocols and introduces a high-performance consensus protocol that supports large-scale node participation. With respect to raw data storage for transactions, Cube Chain has a data availability layer that implements block data sharding and sampling validation schemes to provide efficient and reliable storage services.\u00a0\nFor Rollup and NFT applications, there is no longer a need to rely on external storage solutions as the processing logic and data are fully managed. In addition, Cube Chain has developed a decentralized cross-chain communication protocol named \u201cTime Crossing\u201d, which supports cross-chain DeFi contract calls and is compatible with the Cosmos IBC protocol.\nHuobi Global, the world\u2019s leading crypto exchange, has listed the CUBE token on Primelist at 13:00 (UTC) on 6 June 2022. Primelist is a new token listing platform on Huobi Global that showcases high-quality tokens. With Primelist, participants stand a chance to buy CUBE tokens at low prices and trade them when the event ends.\n\u201cThe mainnet launch signals an important milestone in Cube Chain construction. Moving forward, Cube Chain will continue to develop and maintain its chain with a more modest attitude and a more dedicated spirit,\u201d said Jake Stolarski, CEO of Cube. \u201cActive ecology is also the focus of Cube\u2019s future construction, and we hope more users, assets, and projects can be better developed on Cube Chain.\u201d\nFor more information about the Primelist of Cube Network, please visit here.\nFor more information about Cube, please visit: https://www.cube.network/\n\u00a0About Cube Chain\nCube is a high-performance, scalable and modular layer1 public chain, capable of supporting multi-chain and cross-chain architecture. Compatible with EVM and Cosmos ecosystems, Cube is actively committed to participating in the development of decentralized cross-chain protocols and Web3.0 infrastructure to provide users with the next-generation multi-chain experience.\n\u00a0Contact Cube Chain\nTwitter\uff1ahttps://twitter.com/Cube0x\nTelegram\uff1ahttps://t.me/Cube_Network\n Disclaimer: This is a paid post and should not be treated as news/advice.\n\n\n\nRelated Topics:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss\nWith Cardano [ADA] finding a stable footing, is it getting ready for a jump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAnjali Sriniwasan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Masters in Mass communication and journalism, Anjali's interests lie in blockchain technology adoption across emerging economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may like\n\n\n\nClick to comment\n\n\n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

The company\u2019s digital assets reserves were at A$6.1 billion (approximately US$4.2 billion), which includes the Animoca Brands tokens SAND, QUIDD, PRIMATE, REVV, TOWER, GMEE, and others.\nAccording to the financial report, the company successfully acquired Grease Monkey Games, Darewise, Eden Games, Notre Game and Be Media.

The SPORT token contract is bridged to Polygon Network and BNB Chain.\u00a0\nAlso, in a recent development, the company, along with Blowfish Studios, announced the closure of one of the most anticipated AAA blockchain games.\nAccording to Blockchain.News, the Planet Private Sale for Phantom Galaxies sold 7,734 Planets and Asteroids (\u201cPlanets\u201d) for a total of US$19.3 million.\nHolders of the Planets - which are NFTs - will gain in-game real estate and utility along with a regular emission of the native cryptocurrency of Phantom Galaxies, Blockchain.News added.Image source: Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopied\n Animoca Brands, Blowfish Studios Announces Closure of Planet Private Sale for Phantom Galaxies  \n\n\nBLOCKCHAIN ANIMOCABRANDS NFT CRYPTO GAMES \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\nSubscribe now and get exclusive news, interviews and stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance \n\n\n\nAnimoca Brands Releases Key Unaudited Financial Report, Portfolio investments Worth Over $1.5Bn\n\nJun 07, 2022\n| 3 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews \n\n\n\nPancakeSwap\u2019s Native Token Once Surged by Nearly 10% after Binance Labs Sets Foot in Ecosystem\n\nJun 07, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance \n\n\n\nAlibaba's Ant Group Floats New Digital Bank ANEXT in Singapore\n\nJun 07, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews \n\n\n\nTwitter Deal Sees Further Stalemate, Elon Musk Warns He Can Pull Out His Bid\n\nJun 07, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto News\n\nBitcoin News\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nEthereum News\nCardano News\nRipple News\nStablecoin News\nCBDC News\nDeFi News\nNFT News\n\n\n\nRegulatory News\n\nRegulation\nLegal\nCybercrime\n\n\n\nIndustry News\n\nExchanges\nMining\nData Service\n\n\n\nTechnology News\n\nEnterprise\nBlockchain Application\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nWrite For Us\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy\nTerms & Conditions\nAdvertise\nBlockchain Ecosystem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonetary & Financial Freedom\n\r\n                                With blockchain, we will put an end to the monopoly of government-issued currencies, as suggested in the title of Hayek\u2019s work \u2013 \u201cDenationalization of Money.\u201d Blockchain will simplify the set of concepts revolving around financial services and the complexity of the IT systems.

As the market demonstrated strength, altcoins across the industry attempted to move north. Bitcoin climbed above the $30,000 price level and this extended gains across the altcoin market.\nAt the time of writing, Aave was still quite close to the $104 price level which now acts as a support. The bulls need to amplify in order for the bearish thesis to be invalidated. Over the last week, Aave gained about 10% on its chart. A current fall in price will push the coin below the $103 support line.\nRight now the coin has been facing strong resistance at the $108 price level. For the coin to trade in a bullish price action, it is important for Aave to trade above the $108 resistance level.

Given that PancakeSwap is the most widely used dApp and the DeFi project with the highest TVL on BNB Chain, we have and will continue to provide strong support for the project.\u201d\u00a0\n\nUnlike most other decentralized exchanges, PancakeSwap unitizes\u00a0the BNB Chain, which uses a next-generation consensus mechanism known as Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) to enhance efficiency levels.\u00a0\nTherefore, PancakeSwap represents a turning point for decentralized finance (DeFi) on BNB Chain since it paves the way for many DeFi solutions, including yield farms, synthetics, and wrapped asset swaps.\u202f\u00a0\nPancakeSwap\u2019s AMM model\nUsing an automated market maker (AMM) model, PancakeSwap enables the swapping of BEP-20 tokens and permits users to trade against a liquidity pool.\u00a0\nBNB Chain is a decentralized public blockchain network launched by Binance. It has played an instrumental role in powering the decentralized application (dApp) sector. For instance, it hosts more than 1,300 active dApps in different areas like non-fungible token (NFT), Metaverse, blockchain games, and DeFi.\nAs a result, BNB Chain has carried out at least 3 billion transactions undertaken by 163 million unique addresses since its inception in 2020.\u00a0Image source: Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopied\n Why PancakeSwap is Eating Uniswap\u2019s Lunch  \n\n\nPANCAKESWAP BINANCE LABS INVESTMENT CAKE CRYPTOCURRENCIES BNB CHAIN BINANCE ALTCOINS \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\nSubscribe now and get exclusive news, interviews and stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance \n\n\n\nAnimoca Brands Releases Key Unaudited Financial Report, Portfolio investments Worth Over $1.5Bn\n\nJun 07, 2022\n| 3 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews \n\n\n\nPancakeSwap\u2019s Native Token Once Surged by Nearly 10% after Binance Labs Sets Foot in Ecosystem\n\nJun 07, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance \n\n\n\nAlibaba's Ant Group Floats New Digital Bank ANEXT in Singapore\n\nJun 07, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews \n\n\n\nTwitter Deal Sees Further Stalemate, Elon Musk Warns He Can Pull Out His Bid\n\nJun 07, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto News\n\nBitcoin News\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nEthereum News\nCardano News\nRipple News\nStablecoin News\nCBDC News\nDeFi News\nNFT News\n\n\n\nRegulatory News\n\nRegulation\nLegal\nCybercrime\n\n\n\nIndustry News\n\nExchanges\nMining\nData Service\n\n\n\nTechnology News\n\nEnterprise\nBlockchain Application\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nWrite For Us\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy\nTerms & Conditions\nAdvertise\nBlockchain Ecosystem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonetary & Financial Freedom\n\r\n                                With blockchain, we will put an end to the monopoly of government-issued currencies, as suggested in the title of Hayek\u2019s work \u2013 \u201cDenationalization of Money.\u201d Blockchain will simplify the set of concepts revolving around financial services and the complexity of the IT systems.

Six months down the line, the development team wants to give it real-world utility instead of the memecoin tag that it rode to fame.Sponsored\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored\nShiba Inu\u2019s community is rippling with excitement following reports that Shiberium, a layer-2 blockchain around the network, is nearing completion. Several reports have suggested that the Shibarium testnet will be launched in June with the strongest indicator being the $XFUND Mainnet upgrade expected in May.Sponsored\n\n\n\nSponsored\nShytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of Shiba Inu has dropped several cryptic hints about the development. His latest clue was a GIF that was captioned \u201claughter in Shibarium,\u201d which the community member construed as a positive sign. Shiba Inu enthusiasts are quick to recall Unification\u2019s announcement early in the year that Shibarium\u2019s private testnet development had proceeded to the second stage.\nThe excitement around Shibarium is not far-fetched. A blog post by the team noted that transactions would be \u201capproved in seconds for pennies,\u201d fanning the embers of hope for cheaper transaction fees. Kusama corroborated this on Shiba Discord that \u201cShibarium will offer low fees for every service, game or whatever that builds on it.\u201d\nOther benefits Shibarium could offer the ecosystem acting as a bridge between other blockchains and offering developers the opportunity to build on the platform through the upcoming Shibarium Hackathon. Analysts are already making calls that Shibarium could be the catalyst for a massive price rally for SHIB that will be reminiscent of the highs from 2021.\nShiba Inu has continued to improve on its utility with the foray into the metaverse. A blog post from the team revealed that rewards from land event sales may be available for the holder from July 22. Details in the post indicated that users can get the rewards if they have locked LEASH and placed a bid for \u201cat least once on a land plot, or minted land(s) per wallet\u201d. The team added that the reward distribution was a one-time event.\nTrouble brewing on the Shiba Inu horizon?\nAmid all the hype around the network, the disappearance of Ryoshi, Shiba Inu\u2019s mysterious founder has been a source of worry for investors., The founder deleted his social media accounts and erased all his digital footprints overnight as tongues began to wag over the future of the project.\u00a0\nWhile the community tried rationalizing the founder\u2019s disappearance, a worrying trend reared its head causing further panic. The SHIB burn rate dropped by a staggering 64.2% over the last day as only 54.6 million SHIB tokens were burnt. The impact according to experts is a delay in the bullish impact that it might have on the entire token.\nLead developer Kusama played down the disappearance and claimed that the rest of the team would \u201cactualize Ryoshi\u2019s vision and plan for this grand experiment.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the research team at Finder, an independent comparison site, predicts that Shiba Inu could suffer the same fate as Terra after it crashed, leaving investors with losses running into billions. Despite the absence of an algorithmic stablecoin, Finder cites the absence of real-world application as a reason for a potential crash.Disclaimer\nAll the information contained on our website is published in good faith and for general information purposes only.

After five long years, the securities regulator has launched an investigation on whether Binance violated the securities laws with its 2017 BNB token sale.\nThis is the second major cryptocurrency after the XRP that has come under the SEC scanner. This could be a concerning development for Binance which is already facing major regulatory hurdles across the globe and in the U.S. The U.S. SEC has been keen to bring enforcement actions over some popular ICOs for raising funds.

According to a report published by Solana Labs on June 5, Solana\u2019s fifth outage  of 2022 was caused by a bug in the \u201cdurable nonce transactions feature\u201d  which caused the network to stop producing blocks for roughly four and half hours.\u201cThe durable nonce transaction feature was disabled in releases v1.9.28/v1.10.23 to prevent the network from halting if the same situation were to arise again.\u201d\u201cDurable nonce transactions will not process until the mitigation has been applied, and the feature re-activated in a forthcoming release,\u201d they added.The term durable nonce transactions refers to a type of transaction on Solana that is designed to not expire, unlike a normal transaction on the network which usually has a short lifetime of around 2 minutes before a blockhash becomes too old to be validated. It is generally used to support transactions tied to avenues such as custodial services which require more time than the usual \u201cto produce a signature for the transaction\u201d according to Solana Documentation. Solana Labs noted that durable nonce transactions require a separate \u201cmechanism to prevent double processing, and are processed serially,\u201d however a runtime bug presented itself after a durable nonce transaction was processed as a regular transaction and failed, but was then re-submitted again and resulted in the network grinding to a halt. \u201cAfter the failed transaction was processed, but before the nonce was used again, the user resubmitted the same transaction for processing. This resubmission activated the bug in the runtime,\u201c the p report reads. Related: Is Solana a \u2018buy\u2019 with SOL price at 10-month lows and down 85% from its peak?The price of Solana\u2019s native asset SOL has dropped roughly 13.9% since the mainnet outage on June 1 to sit at $39.08 at the time of writing. Investor appetite to trade the asset has only increased, however, with 24-hour trading volume increasing by 61% to $2.141 billion within that same time frame, according to data from CoinGecko. In a broader sense, data from Solana-focused analytics platform Hello Moon shows that the total value moved on-chain (successfully) in terms of a seven-day rolling average has significantly dropped since late March. After topping out at all-time-high levels of around $3.18 trillion on March 24, the figure has plunged to around $159.71 billion as of June 4.  #Blockchain  #Transactions  #Developers  #Solana  Related News  Bitcoin Price Rally by 2021 Looks Likely From Five Fundamental Factors  Fully managed end-to-end marketplace releases NFTs with high holder rewards  Crypto 401(k): Sound financial planning or gambling with the future?

ADA bulls are once again showing their strength this week after maintaining an upward trajectory during the weekend and well into Monday, 6 June. But can they maintain the same momentum, or are they due for another correction?\nA closer look at ADA\u2019s current price action reveals that the bulls were aided by the lack of enough bearish volume at the end of last week. The bears lacked enough momentum to push the price towards the downside after reaching the 50% RSI level. As a consequence, the slight correction in the first few days of June was rather weak, paving the way for more accumulation and an uptick.\nADA bulls size up the upcoming resistance\nADA traded at $0.625 at press time after a 9.98% rally in the last 24 hours. However, the price uptick has notably pushed ADA into territory that has been tested as resistance at least two times in the past. If a similar outcome occurs, then we should expect another bearish retracement in the next few days is there a breakout potential?\nSource: TradingView\nADA is currently rallying above the 50% RSI level and is now approaching its 50-day Moving Average. The last time ADA traded above the 50-day MA was before mid-April. Such a crossing would encourage more investor confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADA\u2019s uptick is currently underpinned by increasing bullish momentum and some accumulation. It still has room for more upside considering that it is currently trading within a descending and resistance channel. However, the extent of the bullish reign remains uncertain and tied to prevailing market conditions.\nOn-chain metrics may provide a rough but clearer picture of whether ADA will extend its current rally. ADA\u2019s supply distribution by balances on addresses reveals what the top holders, AKA whales, have been doing. For example, addresses holding more than 10 million ADA reduced from 49.13% to 49.08% from 1 June to 6 June.\nSource: Santiment\nAddresses holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA increased from 17.44%\u00a0 to 17.51% between 1 June and 6 June. The market cap bounce back seems to have been more aligned with the latter group.\nConclusion\nWhales accumulating the token seems to ring good news bells for ADA. The probability of breaking through the narrow range is heightened and the potential implication is that ADA\u2019s price floor will likely increase. This is assuming that the market is recovering from the risk-on conditions that prevailed in the last few weeks.\n\n\n\n\nRead the best crypto stories of the day in less than 5 minutes\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to get it daily in your inbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select your Email Preferences.\n\n\nThe Daily Digest\n\n\nThe Weekly Digest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRelated Topics:ADAADA price actionCardanoCardano (ADA)Cardano Hodlersfeatured-main\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't Miss\nThis is why Fantom\u2019s [FTM] 28% rally will be short-lived\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMichael Nderitu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael is a full-time journalist at AMBCrypto.

The startup has inked a 2-year partnership with Proxtera, an entity supported by MAS, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), and the private sector entities to create an open framework for financial institutions.\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s time to offer the next generation of financial services that are accessible and effortless for growing businesses. Amid rapid acceleration in the digital economy, business models are changing and pivoting to become digital-first, if not adopting a hybrid model. Financial services have to evolve and be where SMEs are doing their businesses digitally,\u201d said Ms. Toh Su Mei, a banking veteran who will be leading ANEXT as its Chief Executive Officer.\nSingapore is opening up for a whole lot of financial innovation and the penetration of Ant Group is a testament to this broad embrace.\u00a0\nThe country\u2019s apex bank had also previously granted digital banking licenses to Sea, a technology firm as well as ride-hailing company Grab, both of whom are expected to float their own banking services in the near term. ANEXT customers will be able to open a consumer account and this access will be enabled in the third quarter of the year.\nAnt Group also has a license to serve the corporate and institutional investor group in Singapore as far back as 2020, and the emergence of ANEXT will notably complement its effort across the board.\u00a0\nDigital banks are growing and while they are proliferating across continents, a number of old players like Nubank are beginning to warm up to cryptocurrencies, a move ANEXT may consider in the next few years.Image source: Shutterstock\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopied\n Ant Group Launches Blockchain-Powered System to Help SMEs in Cross-Border Trade  \n\n\nANEXT ANT GROUP ALIBABA DIGITAL BANK NUBANK \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Sign Up\nSubscribe now and get exclusive news, interviews and stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance \n\n\n\nAnimoca Brands Releases Key Unaudited Financial Report, Portfolio investments Worth Over $1.5Bn\n\nJun 07, 2022\n| 3 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews \n\n\n\nPancakeSwap\u2019s Native Token Once Surged by Nearly 10% after Binance Labs Sets Foot in Ecosystem\n\nJun 07, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance \n\n\n\nAlibaba's Ant Group Floats New Digital Bank ANEXT in Singapore\n\nJun 07, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews \n\n\n\nTwitter Deal Sees Further Stalemate, Elon Musk Warns He Can Pull Out His Bid\n\nJun 07, 2022\n| 2 MIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrypto News\n\nBitcoin News\nBitcoin Price Analysis\nEthereum News\nCardano News\nRipple News\nStablecoin News\nCBDC News\nDeFi News\nNFT News\n\n\n\nRegulatory News\n\nRegulation\nLegal\nCybercrime\n\n\n\nIndustry News\n\nExchanges\nMining\nData Service\n\n\n\nTechnology News\n\nEnterprise\nBlockchain Application\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\nWrite For Us\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy\nTerms & Conditions\nAdvertise\nBlockchain Ecosystem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonetary & Financial Freedom\n\r\n                                With blockchain, we will put an end to the monopoly of government-issued currencies, as suggested in the title of Hayek\u2019s work \u2013 \u201cDenationalization of Money.\u201d Blockchain will simplify the set of concepts revolving around financial services and the complexity of the IT systems.

The agency is determining if a possible breach of US securities laws occurred.\nBloomberg first reported the news Monday citing people close to the matter who wished to remain anonymous due to the ICO investigation being a confidential affair. Blockworks attempted to contact the SEC but did not receive a reply by press time.\nThe SEC is also reportedly looking at market-making companies connected to Binance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao whose ownership stakes of market makers on Binance.US have piqued the interest of the regulator, Bloomberg reported. Binance.US and Binance are separate entities.\n\u201cWe have been working very diligently to educate and assist law enforcement and regulators in the US and internationally,\u201d a Binance spokesperson told Blockworks while not commenting directly on the probe. \u201cWe will continue to meet all requirements set by regulators.\u201d\nPublic ICOs were a popular crowdfunding method in bygone years designed to raise funds for budding crypto projects and ecosystems. They have since fallen out of favour following legal uncertainty.\nBinance raised $15 million over the course of 16 days from its ICO listing five years ago where it sold BNB for $0.15 each to the public as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. BNB was last seen changing hands for around $283, down 19.86% year-to-date, according to Messari data.\nBloomberg\u2019s reporting comes amid a separate report by Reuters on Monday alleging Binance processed $2.35 billion in illicit transactions between 2017 and 2020 which are said to have derived from hacks, fraud and the illegal sale of drugs.\nReuters has leaned on two industry experts as well as a 2020 report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis to arrive at its multi-billion dollar figure. Blockworks attempted to contact Chainalysis to corroborate but did not receive a response by press time.\nIt\u2019s the latest string of accusations facing the exchange which landed in regulatory hot water last year over its alleged failure by regulators to appropriately register its business in jurisdictions such as the UK Italy and Singapore.

The underlying assets of the Canadian ETFs are holdings of BTC and ETH held in cold storage by the Gemini crypto exchange.3iQ\u2019s funds join the Bitcoin- and Ether-backed funds by 21Shares and Cosmos Asset Management, the latter of which saw launch delays in April due to a still-unnamed service provider needing time to support the launch.Three ETFs, a Bitcoin and Ether ETF by 21Shares, and a Bitcoin ETF by Cosmos eventually opened to trading in early May, becoming the first crypto ETFs in Australia. Cosmos later released an Ether-backed fund on May 31.Much like 3iQ funds, the underlying assets for the Cosmos ETFs are direct investments into the Canadian Purpose Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, while the funds issued by 21Shares are backed by Bitcoin and Ether reserves held in cold storage by Coinbase.A point of difference is that 3iQ boasts having the lowest expense ratio out of the six at 1.2% \u2014 0.05% lower than the 21Shares and Cosmos ETFs, each with an expense ratio of 1.25%.Related: Amid crypto bear market, institutional investors scoop up Bitcoin: CoinSharesThe three original funds by 21Shares and Cosmos had a sluggish start to trading,\u00a0only seeing $1.3 million in volume on the day of launch, far below the estimated $1 billion of expected inflows. The two 21Shares funds received a total of around $936,500 of total inflows, while Cosmos\u2019 Bitcoin fund received just over $398,000.According to data from Cboe at the time of writing, the two 3iQ ETFs have seen a volume of 13,592 and 9,754 shares traded of the Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, respectively, accounting for around $73,415 and $73,605, respectively, for a total of over $147,000, much smaller than its competitors. #Cryptocurrencies  #Business  #Australia  #ETF  #Stocks  #Stock Investment  #Exchanges  Related News  NFT bubble deemed unsustainable without more market research tools  Crypto 401(k): Sound financial planning or gambling with the future?
